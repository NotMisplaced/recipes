A website for all the recipes I've made and collected.

Cooking has been a passion of mine for years. I began cooking when I was in highschool to prepare myself for living on my own in college. My mom taught me a few simple recipes and I've been branching out collecting recipes and trying new things ever since.

That's the best part of cooking for me: trying new things. I like to think of myself as a mad scientist in the kitchen; I never hesistate to try a new approach for fear of making mistakes, because that's how I also invent some of my most impressive recipes. I believe that, like any skill, once you firmly understand the basic concepts of cooking, it creates room for creativity and ingenuity and you can make something truly wonderful that you're proud to call your own.

I originally kept all my recipes in a notes app on my phone, but I was frustrated at how disorganized and lengthy it was, so I decided to make a website. I hadn't brushed up on my HTML/CSS and JS skills in a while either so it would help me be a better programmer as well. Killing 2 birds with 1 stone. This project serves as a compendium for all the recipes I've collected. Some are "borrowed" from others (credit is given where appropriate), some were passed down to me by my mother, and some are creations of my own.

The cookbook is divided into sections: Breakfast, Soups/Stews/Sauces, Sandwiches, Rice & Pasta, Desserts, The Laboratory (experimental recipes), and Miscellaneous. Each section is denoted by a tab at the top of the page.

My remaining goals for this project:
1. Implement a search system to find recipes by name or tag
2. Implement aesthetic changes so the website has a professional feel to it
3. Create more goals along the way. There's always something to improve!
