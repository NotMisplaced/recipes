	<p class="story">
	Hi! I’m Mihir Lele, and this website is a compilation of recipes I’ve either created or collected from others. Cooking is a huge passion of mine, so I made this website to share 
	that with you! Below I’ve included some helpful reminders about how this site is laid out.
	</p>
	<p class="story">
	Basically, each recipe has 3 sections: Ingredients (what goes in it and how much), Instructions (the basic and necessary steps), and Story Time (an explanation of what the recipe 
	means to me, my journey in making it, and some helpful tips). Often it is best to read the Story Time explanation if you’re making this recipe for the first time, since it is far 
	more detailed than the instructions section and lets you know why I included certain steps. If it’s a simple recipe or you’ve made it before, you don’t have to read any further 
	than the Instructions section.
	</p>
	<p class="story">
	The recipes are split under 7 categories which you can see on the bar at the top. The names are mostly self-explanatory, but you may be confused by The Laboratory. That’s the 
	section for highly experimental recipes that I’ve created. Things that make you stop and think if such foods should ever have been created. But I had fun making them, so I’m sure 
	you will too. Please note that the food does not actually look like Mt. Rainier, I'm just using that as a placeholder image until I get actual pictures of my food.
	</p>
	<p class="story">
	You might notice that sometimes (a lot of times) I don’t include ingredient amounts. In these cases, you have to rely on your taste, your instincts, and/or learn the right 
	amounts through trial-and-error. If you get the measurements wrong, that’s okay, you can always try again. It’ll make you better at cooking. That’s what I love most about 
	cooking: experimenting! The kitchen is like my laboratory. I like finding out what works and what doesn’t and why. Don’t be afraid to take risks in the kitchen either. The 
	recipes here aren’t strict rules. It’s your kitchen and your taste buds, so do whatever you want.

	<!-- About the recipe -->
	<h4 class = "subtitle has-text-centered is-4">Story Time</h4>
	<p class="story">
	I feel like it’s important for everyone to know a few basic recipes, and one recipe everyone should know is buttermilk pancakes. 
	Pancakes are a staple breakfast food in the US and if you ever have guests over in the morning, you can wow them easily by serving them up a homemade short stack. 
	It’s fun and delicious too! I wanted to be able to make the perfect thick & fluffy buttermilk pancakes from scratch, so I looked up a few recipes and tried them out. 
	The first was fine, but not thick enough. The second was certainly fluffy enough, but was lacking in sweetness and flavor. 
	By combining elements of both recipes, as well as experimenting with different ingredient amounts, I was able to create my very own recipe! 
	I encourage you to do the same in your cooking endeavors. Find what works and what doesn’t, and roll with the changes.
	</p>
	<p class="story">
	We start this recipe by sorting out our dry ingredients. Sift a cup of all-purpose flour, 1.5 tsp of baking powder, 0.5 tsp of baking soda, and a pinch of salt into a 
	large mixing bowl. You’ll notice that I use both baking powder and baking soda in this recipe. Both serve the purpose of leavening, which will create bubbles inside the batter 
	to help the pancakes rise. Baking powder contains some baking soda along with some acidic ingredients which react with the soda to release gas which creates bubbles 
	on the inside of the batter when cooking. But why use baking soda when you’re already using baking powder? Baking soda has a very high pH which will neutralize some of 
	the acidity from the buttermilk and improve the browning as well as the rise of the pancake. However, baking soda’s weaknesses are that it needs the buttermilk to activate, 
	and adding too much can change the taste for the worse (it’s very strong!). But baking powder only needs liquid and heat (not acidity) to activate its leavening properties, 
	which means it’s doing the bulk of the leavening here without changing the taste of the batter too much. Salt is added to bring out the flavor of the other ingredients, 
	and it always helps to add it to sweet dishes, even though it’s just a pinch. Truth be told, I can’t always be bothered to sift my dry ingredients, but it does make it 
	easier to avoid lumpy pancakes.
	</p>
	<p class="story">
	Then you want to separate your whites and yolks of your egg. As always, if you leave a little white in the yolk, you’re fine. But yolk in the white is a no-no. 
	The reason is because we want to whip air into the egg whites, almost until it becomes a meringue. This is a very delicate process; you want to make sure your hands are 
	clean and dry. Always keep your whites in a clean, dry, cool, glass or metal bowl. Things like plastic, moisture, grease, soap, and dirt may interfere with the whipping 
	process if they make contact with the whites, causing them to not inflate properly. That being said, whip the separated whites into soft peaks with a whisk. 
	If you can’t be bothered to put that much effort into making pancakes it is totally understandable, as long as you work in plenty of air you should be fine. 
	Now pour the sugar over the yolks. I don’t know why, but I love the look of sugar poured on top of an intact egg yolk. Whisk it together, then stream in your choice of fat here. 
	I tend to go for melted butter, but if you want a slight coconut flavor, you can use coconut oil too. I’ve done it and it tastes great! 
	Be careful using different oils though, as when I was experimenting with this recipe I tried using olive oil. Big mistake. The texture was fine, 
	but you can really taste the choice of fat you use at this stage, and the flavor of olive oil belongs nowhere near pancakes. The point of adding the fat and sugar to the 
	yolks is to help dissolve them in the wet mixture, so when you add the buttermilk, you’re not left with any loose bits of sugar or butter floating around. 
	Now add in the vanilla extract. Even though it isn’t much, it has a huge impact on the flavor to the pancake. If you’re trying to make a holiday version of this recipe, 
	you can try adding a teaspoon of cinnamon and a quarter teaspoon each nutmeg and allspice at this stage as well. Don’t be afraid to experiment with the flavorings! 
	Now it’s finally time for the buttermilk. I tend to use my mother’s recipe for making buttermilk at home which is mixing equal parts yogurt and water until fully homogenous. 
	Buttermilk is like regular milk but far more acidic, which will help activate the baking powder, giving you a taller, fluffier pancake. Gently stream buttermilk into the yolk 
	mixture, whisking constantly until fully combined.
	</p>
	<p class="story">
	Now you have 3 bowls of stuff: your dry mixture, your wet mixture, and your airy egg whites. Despite all the leavening agents, one of the best ways to get air into the 
	pancakes is through the egg whites, which is why it’s important to whip them until either very frothy or developing soft peaks. That is also why it’s important to be careful 
	when you mix your ingredients together. You don’t want to deflate those egg whites and knock out the bubbles. So fold in the whites with a rubber spatula into the wet mixture, 
	adding in one half of the egg at a time until just barely incorporated. Then add that mixture to your dry ingredients in the same manner, gently folding in one half of the wet 
	mixture at a time. Do not overmix here! By adding moisture to the flour, it encourages gluten development, which is necessary to hold the pancake together, but overmixing can 
	cause too much gluten development, which makes the batter very tight and the end product very chewy. Because I enjoy a tender texture to my pancakes, I recommend folding the 
	batter together until just combined. It’s okay if the mixture isn’t very smooth, as long as there are no big chunks of flour left. Leave the batter to rest in the fridge for 
	30-60 minutes. Resting will allow the gluten to relax and the flour to hydrate properly, which will improve the texture of the batter. I know it’s hard to wait, but you can 
	use this time to put away the ingredients you don’t need anymore, and you’ll still have spare time to clean up the flour you spilled everywhere as well.

	Once ready, scoop a half-ladle of batter (adjust amount to your liking) onto a pan heated over medium heat and greased with butter. Do NOT touch that batter once it’s on there. 
	Don’t try and make the edges perfectly round, don’t try and peek underneath it or jiggle it around. Just let it cook. Let those bubbles do their job undisturbed.

	chocolate chips, or whatever topping you want Once you see bubbles begin to pop in the middle of the pancake, it’s time to gently flip it over with your most trusted spatula. 
	Cook on the other side for 30-60 seconds until the bottom is browned and you can’t see any raw batter from the sides. Don’t get discouraged if the first pancake isn’t great. 
	It might be a little underdone in the middle, in which case you should let the next one cook longer. It might not brown properly or rise evenly. Whatever the case is, it’s 
	really good for learning what you need to adjust for the following pancakes, so just remember the Golden Rule of Pancakes: the first pancake is always sacrificial.

	<!-- About the recipe -->
	<h4 class="subtitle has-text-centered is-4">Story Time</h4>
	<p class="story">
	In English, we call it French toast, but the French  call it “pain perdu” (lost bread). The recipe itself actually originates in the Roman Empire, 
	as detailed in the <em>Apicius</em>, a cookbook compiled by the Romans sometime around 400 AD. What?? Ancient Romans, making French toast? It sounds 
	so weird until you realize it’s just bread soaked in milk and eggs and fried. Pretty simple, but the name we’ve given it in English makes it sound so fancy. 
	I started this recipe by looking up a basic recipe for French toast. Mix milk, eggs, cinnamon, and sugar, then dip some stale, thick-sliced bread in it and fry. 
	Sounds easy enough (and it really is) but there’s a few tips and tricks I’ve picked up that might help you make your best French toast.
	</p>
	<p class="story">
	First we start with the bread. I’ve made this several times with just regular whole-wheat bread, and I must say, it really is subpar. 
	Your choice in bread really matters here, so opt for a brioche, challah, or similar bread here. If you can’t get your hands on a bread like that, 
	you can use regular sliced bread as well and it’ll be fine, but as I mentioned, it isn’t nearly as delicious. I once went to the farmer’s market with my roommate 
	and saw one stand selling loaves of chocolate chip challah bread. I knew right away I had to make this recipe with it, and I must say, it was the best French toast I ever made. 
	Cutting the bread into thick slices (about an inch thick at least) will allow it to develop the soft, custardy inside you expect from a classic French toast. 
	In order to absorb the liquid properly, it’s important to use stale bread. After all, this recipe is a popular way to reconstitute old, dry bread. 
	The quickest way to get your bread stale is to spread out the slices on a wire rack overnight and let it dry out. That way, when you wake up, you’re ready to make that 
	sweet, sweet toast.
	</p>
	<p class="story">
	For the dipping liquid, it is best to start by mixing the cinnamon, sugar, and salt into the eggs first, then add the milk after the other ingredients are evenly combined. 
	The order is important, because those who make French toast know adding cinnamon to a milk mixture leads to unevenly dispersed swirls of cinnamon. 
	However, when combined with the eggs alone, the cinnamon disperses evenly, and streaming in the milk slowly will lead to a dipping liquid that holds the cinnamon much better 
	than if the milk had gone beforehand. This liquid should be mixed and contained in a Tupperware or pie dish, whatever is wide enough to hold a slice of bread but deep enough 
	to soak the slice through (it doesn’t need to be fully submerged). I’ve found that 3 thick brioche slices are enough to soak up the amount of liquid used in this recipe, 
	but you’d need to double the number of slices if using regular sliced bread. Remember that it’s far better to have too much liquid than too much bread. 
	If you’re like me and you don’t like wasting any leftover liquid, mix some flour into it after you’re done cooking and make a pancake or two for yourself. 
	They’re not going to be great, but at least they’re not going to waste.
	</p>
	<p class="story">
	French toast tastes fine on its own, but the toppings will elevate your breakfast to another level. I consider powdered sugar to be a necessity on French toast, 
	since it looks pretty and it adds a very delicate sweetness to the dish. Do not assume granulated sugar to ever be an acceptable substitute where powdered sugar is required. 
	Trust me, I once accidentally made a frosting recipe using regular sugar and it felt like I was chewing on candied sand. So take some powdered sugar and sift a little snowfall 
	onto your perfectly plated French toast. I like doing the powdered sugar after all the other toppings, but the order is up to you and it really depends on what toppings you use. 
	Maple syrup is a classic, but the possibilities are endless. You can slap some peanut butter and jelly on there and make a French toast PB&J. Or you could throw down a little 
	sriracha and mayo on there to make all your friends gag at brunch. Or maybe slather on some peanut butter and top with bananas and bacon bits for an Elvis-inspired take on it. 
	Cream cheese and basil? Sure! Greek yogurt with honey and chopped pistachios? Go right ahead! Condensed milk with fresh berries? Yes, as long as you save me a slice. 
	You can even take a look at some of my other recipes like my banana caramel or apple filling (both of which I made to eat with French toast). It’s all up to you.

	<!-- About the recipe -->
	<h4 class="subtitle has-text-centered is-4">Story Time</h4>
	<p class="story">
	Making your own tomato sauce at home is one of those little things that makes a big difference. You can control the flavors, the ingredients, 
	the texture, even the moisture level of the sauce for various applications. And believe me, there are so many applications for this recipe. 
	You can have this with pasta, gnocchi, meatballs, lasagna, pizza, sandwiches, or even drink it out of a vase to freak people out on the subway. 
	In any case, it’s fun, rewarding, and kind of a big flex to be able to whip up fresh tomato sauce in 30 minutes for dinner.
	</p>
	<p class="story">
	The recipe starts with tomatoes. I recommend using a large can of whole, peeled San Marzano tomatoes. These are really good quality and absolutely worth it. 
	The reason why I prefer them whole is so I can control the texture of the sauce a little better. If you don’t have these, or don’t want to spring for them, 
	that’s totally fine, I’ve got you covered. Just use 3 Roma tomatoes and you should be fine (though keep in mind that the texture and taste are going to be very different, 
	but still good). If you’re using the fresh tomatoes, you don’t want the skin on there, so use a knife to make an X on one end of each tomato and let them sit in boiling 
	water for about a minute. Fish out the tomatoes and cool off in cold water. This process allows the skin to come off easily without overcooking the tomato. 
	Once you peel them, dice them up into small cubes. You could blend them, but that incorporates a lot of air into the tomatoes, changing the color and texture, which is fine, 
	but I personally prefer the dicing method.
	</p>
	<p class="story">
	Now that the tomatoes are prepared, mince the onion as finely as you possibly can and cook with basil, dried oregano, and red pepper flakes in olive oil over medium heat. 
	You can use fresh basil or even fresh oregano if you want, but you don’t have to. Keep in mind that overcooking fresh basil makes it bitter, so you want to keep this mixture 
	moving. Using a lot of olive oil (enough to coat the bottom of the pan) is important, because it’s going to pick up all the little flavors from the aromatics and seasonings 
	make the sauce very flavorful. In the meantime, chop the garlic into paper-thin slices. I saw it in a scene in Goodfellas while they were making sauce, and that’s how I cut 
	garlic for my sauces ever since. It’s not just to try to look cool, the thin slices have a high surface area to volume ratio, making the shape ideal for leaching out the 
	aromatic compounds of the garlic into the sauce. Mincing them has a similar effect, but slicing allows you to see the garlic in the final product, and until you’ve had a 
	slice of garlic melt in your mouth, you haven’t lived. Okay fine, maybe I just do it so I can pretend to be a cool Italian mobster, but the other stuff is still true. 
	You’ll notice I limit myself to 2 cloves of garlic in this recipe. You can add more if you want, but if you’re making Italian food, just remember that Italians don’t 
	actually add that much garlic to their dishes at all, as that’s more of an Italian-American thing. Add the garlic to the pan when the onions begin to brown. 
	If they seem a little too dark, that’s okay too. The point of cutting them that finely is to get them to caramelize. The onion doesn’t add a lot of onion flavor 
	because of this, but it does add a gentle sweetness which is good to balance the acidity of the tomatoes. Once the garlic goes from a stark white to a gentler blond color, 
	it’s tomato time.
	</p>
	<p class="story">
	Add the tomatoes to the pan and crush them with a wooden spoon, simmering on high heat. The wooden spoon is non-negotiable when making this dish. 
	Every grandma knows that the wooden spoon picks up character over time with every dish you make and that all the love and experience that it accumulates will transfer 
	into your food. The first time I made this sauce, my spoon was new. I oversalted the sauce, didn’t mash the tomatoes well, and the whole thing turned out a bit of a mess. 
	I must’ve made this recipe a hundred times since then, and now my spoon and I both know exactly how to make the perfect tomato sauce.
	</p>
	<p class="story">
	In addition to becoming smoother from crushing the tomatoes, the sauce should reduce and concentrate in flavor over time. While you’re stirring it constantly, 
	it’s important to let a little sauce accumulate on the edges or walls of the pan, as those bits will darken and deepen in flavor, essentially turning into tomato paste. 
	Once the little bits around the edges look like that, go ahead and mix them into your sauce. When the sauce thickens enough that you can draw a line in it with the spoon 
	and it doesn’t flow back together, you’re done. I call this point the Moses Stage, because you know you’ve reached it when you can part the Red Sea. Taste a little, adjust 
	seasoning, and store in a container that can’t be stained by tomatoes.
	</p>
	<p class="story">
	If you need this sauce for pasta, warm some up in a pan, then when the pasta is cooked, dump the pasta plus a little pasta cooking liquid into the pan with the sauce. 
	The reason you use the pasta water is so you can reconstitute the concentrated sauce and make it more liquid again, and also because pasta water is seasoned well with salt 
	(or at least it should be if you want your pasta to taste good) and is high in starch that it picked up from the pasta. The starch allows for thickening, making a smooth, 
	creamy sauce. Toss the pasta, sauce, and water over a medium heat until the sauce becomes fully reconstituted by the water and the starch allows it to thicken slightly into 
	a cohesive sauce.
	</p>
	<p class="story">
	That’s just one way to use this recipe. Like I said, there are many applications for tomato sauce. Feel free to make it your own as well. If you want to add a splash of 
	vodka or red wine, I’ve tried the latter and it’s very good. Just make sure not to overdo it and to cook out as much alcohol as possible. If you want to add parmesan, 
	throw some in towards the end. This is your chance to make it your own. Put a lot of love and care into this one and the results will astound you.

	<h4 class="subtitle has-text-centered is-4">Story Time</h4>
	<p class="story">
	Full disclosure, this chicken and sausage gumbo is the best thing I have ever cooked in my life. And while we’re in the spirit of disclosure, 
	I must admit I did not write this recipe. This was taken from famous Cajun chef Isaac Toups when he made a guest appearance on Binging with Babish. 
	I haven’t made much Cajun cooking, and really, I have no exposure to southern cooking or soul food at all, having grown up on the west coast. 
	But as always, the recipes you find here are in the spirit of trying new things, so I figured, why not give it a go? If you’re like me and you’ve never had Cajun cuisine before, 
	let me take you on my journey of discovery and share some tips I picked up from the Cajun cooking community.
	</p>
	<p class="story">
	“First, you make a roux.” An introductory sentence that is the hallmark of most Cajun recipes. Roux is added to thicken liquid-based dishes like soups, stews, and sauces. 
	The thickening properties of roux come from flour, which has starch molecules that absorb water and swell up, causing an ordinarily thin liquid to become far richer in texture. 
	Of course, raw flour tastes like absolute cheeks, which can be mitigated by cooking it in fat. Keep in mind when cooking roux that thickness and flavor are inversely proportional. 
	A lightly cooked roux (white roux) will contribute no flavor, but is the best for thickening. This type of roux is used in bechamel sauce. A deeply toasted roux 
	(chocolate/dark-brown roux) has a far more complex flavor with nutty, earthy elements to it, but doesn’t produce nearly as thick of a stew. This is the roux that is used in gumbo. 
	Start by getting your oil smoking hot in a pan and add an equal amount of flour. Whisk constantly to combine and keep whisking until you get the right color. 
	Patience is key, as you really want your roux to get to that dark chocolate stage. It’s important to never stop whisking, as the roux is on such high heat that it will burn 
	if left alone. If you burn it, that’s okay, just start over. It happens to everyone (not me though, because I’m perfect). The trick is to pay attention to the edges and 
	corners of the pot, and adjust the heat if you feel like it’s darkening too quickly. The darker it gets, the more you have to whisk it to prevent burning. 
	The entire process takes me under 40 minutes, but you should be willing to spend well over an hour on this stage if you feel like you might burn it.
	</p>
	<p class="story">
	Once the roux looks like the color of dark chocolate, immediately add your trinity. Trinity in Cajun cooking refers to a combination of onion, celery, and green bell pepper. 
	This works much the same as a mirepoix (or sofrito, if you prefer the Italian term), but the sweetness of the carrot is replaced by that of the bell pepper. 
	I like to have these all diced up before even making the roux, as you can’t really prepare the roux and the trinity at the same time. Once in the roux, 
	season lightly with salt to draw out some moisture and add the bay leaves for flavor. Bay leaves add a very subtle flavor. You don’t always know they’re there, 
	but they definitely add that extra oomph that kicks any stew up a notch. Once the vegetables cook down a little and release their fragrance 
	(it shouldn’t take long, since they’re practically flash-frying in the roux), add the minced garlic. It is important to add the garlic later because the vegetables cool down 
	the pot and add moisture which prevents the garlic from instantly burning.
	</p>
	<p class="story">
	Now you’re ready to add the beer. Be sure to use a flavorful beer here, as it will enhance the taste of the gumbo. If you can’t have beer for religious or health reasons, 
	I’m sure water will work fine as well. But if you’re thinking about skimping out on beer because you dislike beer, please don’t skip this step. 
	I served this recipe to a friend who detests the taste of beer and she loved it. Not only does most of the alcohol (over 75%) cook off, the beer flavor is more of a 
	background player that enhances the dish. The only way you would be able to tell the beer was there is if you were looking for it. Beer also serves the purpose of deglazing, 
	so you pick up any errant bits of flour or vegetables that stuck themselves to the bottom of the pot. Make sure the beer is cold, so it combines better with the roux. 
	In the words of Chef John of Food Wishes, “hot roux, cold milk, no lumps.” There’s no milk in this recipe, but the principle stands. Whisk in the beer gradually. 
	If you bought a can bigger than 8 oz, feel free to take a couple sips as well. Have fun with it. Once all the beer is mixed in, stream in the chicken stock. 
	Keep whisking until it's all one big soup. This is going to cool down the pot quite a bit, and you need to wait for it to come back up to a simmer before adding other ingredients. 
	So let’s go prepare those in the meantime.
	</p>
	<p class="story">
	The meat is the key to this whole thing. After all, it is called “chicken and sausage gumbo”. For the chicken, you want to use boneless, skinless thighs. 
	Thighs tend to be more flavorful and juicier than breasts, which is why we use them here. Get a pan smoking hot and add a little oil, like you’re about to cook a steak. 
	Season the chicken with salt and pepper and lay onto the pan. When frying, always lay the food away from you to prevent oil splashing on you. Let the chicken sit for a minute 
	until it develops a beautiful brown crust. Flip and get a similar crust on the other side. This crust is caused by the Maillard reaction. Basically, a lot of complex chemical 
	processes occur with amino acids when proteins are broken down by excessive heat, adding a depth of color and flavor that turns any meat-based dish from good to great. 
	In order to get Maillard browning, the surface of the food must reach around 300 degrees Fahrenheit, which is why keeping your pan on very high heat is important. 
	You definitely don’t want to burn or char the chicken so do be wary not to let it sit too long. By the time you take it off, the chicken should be a nice medium-rare. 
	Beautiful. Don’t worry though, by the time the gumbo is done, that chicken will be so tender it’ll fall apart in your mouth. As for the sausage, I highly recommend andouille, 
	but any smoked sausage will do. The sausage lends a wonderful, warm, smoky flavor that really ties the whole dish together. Slice the sausages into coins, about half-inch thick, 
	and add it to the pot along with the chicken thighs after the pot reaches a simmer.
	</p>
	<p class="story">
	Now for the seasoning. Add some cayenne and smoked paprika. Do not fear the cayenne, it won’t make the gumbo too spicy. It’s more of a gentle warmth that resonates 
	through your entire body, like being given a hug from the inside out. I never happen to have smoked paprika on hand, so I just use regular paprika and that works fine. 
	I usually just add paprika for color, as it doesn’t taste like much, but I have recently found that, like the bay leaf, it adds a certain oomph to the dish that takes 
	it to the next level. At this point, I’m realizing this recipe takes so many things to the next level, it’s no wonder it tastes this good. For the pepper, you’re going to 
	want to trust me on this one. Crank freshly ground pepper into the pot until you feel discomfort in your wrist. Yes, I understand that’s like over 30 cranks of pepper. 
	Yes, I know that’s a lot. But that’s what I heard from Isaac Toups, and he does this professionally, so take his word for it if not mine. This dish has a long time to cook, 
	and pepper mellows out pretty easily. If I want that pepper flavor to be very pronounced when I’m cooking, I usually add it closer to the end. But if I want it to be more 
	subtle and well-blended, like in gumbo, I add it while it still has plenty of time to simmer. Give the pot a quick stir and put a lid on it. Leave it to simmer for a full hour. 
	Yes, I understand you’ve been cooking a while already. Yes, I know that’s a lot. But you want those sausages to plump up and release their flavor. You want that chicken 
	to become tender. You want that roux to cook all the way through (even though it’s toasted, the flour will still taste chalky unless cooked for a long time).
	</p>
	<p class="story">
	After it’s done cooking, give it a little stir. Break up the chicken a little into more manageable pieces using the whisk. Taste for seasoning, adjusting as necessary, 
	then slice up some scallions. You can eat this either as a stew on a bed of white rice or as a soup on its own. Either way, once it’s in the bowl, top with the sliced 
	scallions and enjoy. Make this recipe and I defy you not to smile after the first bite.

	<!-- About the recipe -->
	<h4 class="subtitle has-text-centered is-4">Story Time</h4>
	<p class="story">
	People think of chicken tikka masala as a stereotypical Indian food, but really it’s thought to have originated from Indian immigrants living in Scotland. 
	It has become a fan favorite all across the UK, and some even consider it their national dish. Despite the complexity of flavors, the dish itself is quite simple, 
	though it does require some preparation in advance.
	</p>
	<p class="story">
	The recipe begins with a double marinade, a trick I picked up from Madhur Jaffrey’s take on this recipe. First, cut your boneless, skinless chicken thighs into 1 inch cubes, 
	then put them in a bowl. You could do this with breasts, but thighs work better because they’re more flavorful. Season with salt and about half a lemon’s juice. 
	You only need enough juice to coat the chicken, you don’t want them to be swimming in a pool of lemonade. Massage the salt and lemon juice into the chicken with your hands, 
	making sure each piece is coated evenly. Let sit covered at room temperature for 20 minutes. The reason we do this part of the marinade is to let the salt and acidity 
	flavor the meat while breaking down the proteins, resulting in tender, juicy chicken.
	</p>
	<p class="story">
	Now comes the tricky part: the yogurt marinade. Start by adding the spices to your chicken. Ginger and garlic should be the main flavors used, so either using a couple tablespoons 
	of homemade ginger-garlic paste or using a lot of ground ginger and garlic powder works here. I also recommend adding a heavy amount of paprika as well, 
	as it adds a very subtle warmth and works better in larger quantities. I recommend going a bit lighter on spices like black pepper, coriander seed, cumin, and cayenne. 
	They add warmth and strong flavor, but are not the star flavors of this dish, so use them in moderation. I recommend using even less on fennel, allspice, cloves, and cinnamon. 
	With fennel it’s fine to add a bit more, but the other three are very strong and you don’t want them to take over the flavor profile. We want the warmth and some of the flavor 
	of spices like cinnamon, but be a little more stingy unless you want your chicken to taste like French toast. Of course, the ratios of the spices and flavorings become far 
	simpler if you have premade garam masala powder, so you can replace the cinnamon, cloves, allspice, coriander, cumin, and fennel with the same amount of garam masala. 
	“Garam masala” is Hindi for “hot spice” and contains a lot of warm flavors that are fundamental to a fair amount of Indian cuisine, as the name suggests. 
	But why add yogurt to the marinade? Are the spices not enough? Yogurt is not only acidic, adding to the tenderizing capabilities of the lemon, it also has a thick consistency 
	that allows it to coat the meat better, which allows for even distribution of spices. In addition, when we sear the chicken, the proteins and sugars in yogurt caramelize and 
	provide a beautiful, flavorful crust that is the star of this dish. Add the yogurt and mix it with the spices to form a marinade that fully coats the chicken, 
	and do not leave any crevice uncovered. I like using a few heaped spoonfuls of Greek yogurt, but any plain yogurt will do, preferably full-fat yogurt. 
	It’s okay to use a little more yogurt than necessary, as that can be added back into the gravy later. Let sit covered in the fridge for at least 3 hours.
	</p>
	<p class="story">
	Add some vegetable oil to a pan and get it smoking hot. I like using a pan with higher walls or a dutch oven-like pot to do this, since we’re going to be making the gravy 
	in the same pan. Add the chicken and sear one side for about 1-2 minutes before flipping and doing the same on the other side. It should be blackened somewhat on both sides. 
	Don’t worry, it isn’t ruined, charring the meat will add a tremendous amount of flavor. Also, by heating it that quickly, you don’t cook it all the way through, so don’t go 
	for a taste test just yet. The chicken will finish cooking in the gravy which will impart a tremendous amount of flavor and ensure that the chicken retains a juicy, tender inside. 
	Make sure to sear the chicken in batches so you don’t overcrowd the pan. Giving the chicken pieces some room to breathe ensures that each piece has a chance to fully touch the 
	pan’s surface and the excess water that evaporates off the chicken won’t interfere with developing that charred crust on the meat either.
	</p>
	<p class="story">
	Once your chicken is ready, place it on the side. Look inside the pan. You’ll notice little charred bits stuck to the bottom swimming in some flavored oil and grease. 
	Do not clean that out. That is going to contribute so much flavor to the gravy, you don’t want to waste a drop. To ensure you pick up all that flavor, add the sliced onions 
	with a couple tablespoons of oil and fry on medium high heat with a touch of salt to draw out some moisture and a generous pinch of whole cumin seeds. 
	The reason we fry them with the cumin is to wake up the flavor in those seeds by lightly toasting them so they contribute maximum flavor to the rest of the dish. 
	Use the onions to pick up all the fond and charred bits and cook until sweated through. Now add a pinch of turmeric, minced garlic, ground ginger (or fresh grated), 
	and green bell pepper. When cooking things like this with a lot of vegetables, it’s important to take stock of how long each ingredient needs to cook. For instance, 
	it’s okay to cook the onion for a little longer, but adding the garlic too soon would risk burning it. You can time when you need to add the next ingredients that way as well, 
	the way you know to add the bell pepper when the onion begins to sweat out. When the onion becomes more translucent and you can smell the bell pepper cooking, 
	it’s a good time to add the next ingredients. Put in the tomato along with a tablespoon or two of ground coriander and a third as much of ground cumin 
	(tip: a teaspoon is a third of a tablespoon). You might be asking, “But why add ground cumin when you already have the whole cumin seeds from before?” To that I say, shut up. 
	Cumin tastes good. Adding ground spices in high quantities also allows the gravy to thicken and provides a lot of substance. This is the trickiest part of the dish. 
	Fry the vegetables together on medium-high heat, mashing the tomato as it cooks. That’s why the tomato had to be diced so finely before adding it, so that it would become 
	paste-like in the pan when mushed together. Once it reaches a consistency resembling a paste with chunks of onion and bell pepper, it will eventually start leaking a bit of oil. 
	The oil will begin to slightly pool around the outside of the paste and sizzle. That’s the indicator that you’ve cooked the mixture long enough to fully cook the spices. 
	It takes a bit of practice to identify this stage, but when you can, you’ll be able to make a perfect curry every time.
	</p>
	<p class="story">
	Now add in water. Not too much, but enough so that if you added the chicken, it would be just fully submerged in the gravy. Stir until the gravy is homogenous. Of course, 
	this will cool down the pan quite a bit, so it may take a while for it to reheat. Once it reaches a simmer, add a hefty shake of paprika and a pinch or two of cayenne. 
	Ordinarily, one would add the cayenne closer to the beginning with the onion and bell pepper, but I was taught the fundamentals of Indian cooking by my mother. 
	Indian cuisine is incredibly diverse and uses a lot of different practices. According to my mom, a hallmark of Marathi cooking is adding the chili powder closer to the end 
	of the dish after the water. Because my family is from the state of Maharashtra, those cooking traditions were passed on to me. Once the paprika and cayenne are incorporated, 
	add the chicken and cover with a lid, simmering on low for 10-15 minutes. The longer you let the chicken stew, the more tender it will be, but it’s hard to wait any longer than 
	10 minutes for such a delicious dish.
	</p>
	<p class="story">
	While that’s cooking, take some time to clean the mess you made in the kitchen and prepare your cilantro by separating the leaves and stems. 
	I can understand omitting the cilantro if you have the gene that makes it taste soapy, but a few sprigs of fresh cilantro make such a huge difference. 
	The reason we take apart the cilantro like this is because the leaves work better as a garnish and the stems provide flavor to the gravy when stewed for a bit. 
	Before adding in the stems, get the bowl with the leftover yogurt marinade. If you have no leftover marinade, just use a couple small spoonfuls of yogurt. 
	Adding in a bit of yogurt to the gravy one spoon at a time and stirring it until it becomes homogenous mellows out the curry and gives it a creamier texture. 
	Once you stir in all the leftover yogurt, chop up the cilantro stems and add to the curry. Cover the pot and let sit on low for 2-5 minutes. Serve over rice with chopped cilantro 
	leaves as a garnish and enjoy. This is a delicious dish, but just think about the principles you’ve learned from this one recipe: making a yogurt marinade, searing and stewing meat, 
	and the basic technique to make a perfect curry with whatever meats or vegetables you want.

	<!-- About the recipe -->
	<h4 class="subtitle has-text-centered is-4">Story Time</h4>
	<p class="story">
	If you could choose your last meal, what would you have? I know mine would be my mom’s rajma, no contest. Rich, spicy gravy with ruby-red kidney beans poured lovingly over a bed 
	of basmati rice. That’s the good stuff. It’s nutritious, delicious, and incredibly filling. If my mom makes it, I just know I’m going to be eating rajma and rice for lunch for 
	the next 3 days. I’m sorry to say that you’ll never make it as good as my mom. I can’t do it either, that’s for sure. But that shouldn’t stop you from trying, because even if 
	you mess it up, it’s hard to beat a dish that’s this good.
	</p>
	<p class="story">
	Start by preparing your kidney beans. After all, that’s what “rajma” means in Hindi: kidney beans. If you’re doing this the right way, you’ll use a cup and a half of dry kidney 
	beans. You’ll soak them in cold water overnight for about 10 hours before cooking with them. You’ll begin boiling them in a separate pot while you prepare the rest of the curry, 
	since they’ll need to boil at least an hour to cook through. Of course, if you’re not fond of using more than 1 pot or if you’re lazy like me, you’ll just use 2 cups of canned, 
	pre-cooked kidney beans. You will, of course, save hours of time, but the trade-off is a major reduction in the quality of the flavor.
	</p>
	<p class="story">
	While your soaked beans are boiling (or your canned beans are sitting in their can), begin heating up 3 tablespoons of vegetable oil on medium high heat. When shimmering, 
	add bay leaves and half a tablespoon of cumin seeds. While that toasts, chop up 1 medium onion finely and add it to the pot along with the ginger. Let the onion sweat out 
	and move it occasionally. In the meantime, finely dice 2 tomatoes and add them once the onion is translucent along with 3 tablespoons coriander powder, 1 tablespoon cumin powder, 
	1 teaspoon of fennel, and a pinch of salt. Do not skip any of these spices, omitting a single one will change the flavor completely, trust me. Once you mix everything together, 
	add turmeric and cayenne powder along with a spoonful of tomato paste. The tomato paste isn’t necessary, but it does add flavor, richness, and speeds up the cooking process a bit, 
	since you don’t have to cook the tomatoes as much. Stir as you cook, mashing the tomatoes until a paste-like consistency is achieved. Once the paste begins releasing little pools 
	of sizzling oil, that means the spices are cooked through.
	</p>
	<p class="story">
	Next, add the beans to the mix and add enough water to just barely cover them. The soaked beans should have been going for about half an hour at least, 
	so now they’ll only need another half-hour to fully cook through. The canned beans are pre-cooked, so they’ll only need another 10 minutes to assimilate with the flavors 
	of the dish. Once you add the beans and their water, bring to a simmer, turn down the heat, cover with a lid and continue to let it simmer for 30 or 10 minutes, depending 
	on whether you used soaked or canned beans respectively.
	</p>
	<p class="story">
	While the beans are cooking, separate the stems from the leaves of the cilantro and roughly chop them up. When the beans are about 5 minutes away from being done, uncover the lid 
	and check the beans. If they are soft and mash easily, they’re ready. If not, put the lid back on and continue cooking until they are. When ready, smash at least a quarter 
	of the beans against the sides of the pot. This will release the paste inside the beans which will add body and flavor to the gravy. Add the cilantro stems and stir well. 
	Cover with a lid for another 5 minutes and then taste for seasoning, adjusting salt as necessary.
	</p>
	<p class="story">
	Serve the rajma over rice and top with cilantro leaves, ghee, and some slices of raw red onion if you’re feeling fancy. The ghee really makes the biggest difference here, 
	it’s just not the same without a spoonful of it melting over the top. You might notice that you’ve made way too much, as it’s a very filling dish. That’s okay, it’s one of 
	those special foods like lasagna that taste just as good when reheated the next day. Packed with iron, fiber, protein, and most of all, flavor, rajma is a wonderful weeknight 
	meal to add to your repertoire.

	<!-- About the recipe -->
	<h4 class="subtitle has-text-centered is-4">Story Time</h4>
	<p class="story">
	Sometimes I have trouble falling asleep at night. When that happens, I get bored. Usually I just watch YouTube until I get tired, but one night, for whatever reason, 
	I stayed up and wrote a recipe for vegetable noodle soup from scratch. I just wrote it for kicks, it wasn’t until months later that I found it in my notes and decided to make it. 
	And somehow, without ever needing to tweak the recipe through trial and error, I managed to write a perfect soup recipe in that one sleepless night. Soup is an incredibly 
	versatile group of dishes, so this recipe will show you not only the technique for making a good soup base that can be used for chicken noodle or veggie noodle soup, 
	but also how to make fresh pasta in your kitchen from scratch.
	</p>
	<p class="story">
	Start by making the noodles. This recipe doesn’t use many measurements, because this is something that is best learned with practice and made with instinct. 
	Dump out some all-purpose (or 00 flour if you can find it) onto a clean, dry countertop. Make a crater in the middle of the flour mound you’ve created to make a well just 
	big enough to hold 2 eggs. Crack the aforementioned eggs into a bowl, whisk together and pour them into the well. This dough dries out very quickly, so add a drizzle of olive oil 
	over the top and sprinkle a little salt for seasoning. Using a fork, start bringing clumps of flour into the egg mixture and whisking to combine. Continue until a moist dough 
	forms. It’s okay (it’s actually preferable) if you don’t use all of the flour on the counter. Use your hands to start kneading the dough. If there are still wet portions of the 
	dough, roll it in some flour and continue to knead. The flour on the counter is now acting as a non-stick coating and preventing the tacky dough from gluing itself to the table.
	</p>
	<p class="story">
	Knead it for about 10 minutes until the dough becomes smooth. When poked, it should start to spring back due to the gluten development. Form into a ball, cover tightly on all 
	sides with plastic wrap, and let rest for 30 minutes at room temperature. As I mentioned before, all that kneading has caused gluten to develop. Gluten is a protein that becomes 
	increasingly complex the more you mix flour with water. This will keep the dough held together and give it a nice chew, but that tightness also makes it more difficult 
	to roll out, as it tries to retain its shape like a rubber band. Resting the dough, even for half an hour, will let the dough finish hydrating slowly and allow the gluten to 
	relax, which will make all the difference in the world.
	</p>
	<p class="story">
	Once your dough wakes up from its little power nap, cut it into quarters. Rolling out the dough one quarter at a time will make it easier to work with, but the tradeoff is that 
	some pieces of dough may dry out sooner than others, so you’ll have to work quickly. Sprinkle down some bench flour (that’s the fancy term for putting flour on a surface so the 
	dough doesn’t stick) and put some flour on your rolling pin as well. Roll out slightly and fold the dough lengthwise in thirds. This is known as laminating the dough and it 
	creates layers in the dough which give it a better texture. Roll out the folded rectangle, making sure it’s as even as possible, until it’s so thin that it becomes translucent. 
	They say you should “be able to read a love letter through it”, but since nobody writes me those, I roll it out until I can see my fingers through it when I hold the dough under 
	the light. At this stage, the pasta is ready to cut. Fold it gently, so as not to crease it, then cut thin strips. Unfold the strips and dust with some extra flour. 
	Bunch them in a nest and make strips out of the rest of the dough and let them dry out on the counter. The advantage to making noodles from scratch is not only flavor, 
	but you could theoretically make whatever shape you wanted, not just noodles. Try mixing it up by cutting the sheets of dough into small rectangles and pinching the middle to 
	create little bowties!
	</p>
	<p class="story">
	Now that the noodles are taken care of, only one part of Noodle Soup remains. Dice up onion, carrot, and celery into similar sized pieces in roughly equal amounts. 
	This trio of vegetables is called a <em>mirepoix</em> in French (or <em>sofrito</em> in Italian). They act as aromatics, lending a tremendous amount of well-balanced flavor to 
	virtually any dish. At this stage, you can also mince the garlic and chop up any other vegetables you might want to add.
	</p>
	<p class="story">
	If you plan on using meat, cut it on a separate cutting board with a clean knife, season the meat with salt and pepper, and turn your pot onto high heat. Add a small amount of 
	a neutral oil such as vegetable oil and sear the meat. It is not important to cook the meat all the way through at this stage, the whole point of this is to develop a brown 
	crust on the outside of the meat as fast as possible. This is known as the Maillard reaction, and the caramelized proteins that result from it provide an incredible depth of 
	flavor that takes your dish from okay to mind-blowing. Take out the meat when the crust forms and you’ll see some rendered fat and brown residue in the pan. Do not clean that out. 
	The fat contains flavor, and the brown stuff, called “fond”, is going to give the soup that depth of flavor that was mentioned earlier.
	</p>
	<p class="story">
	Whether or not you are using meat, the next steps are the same. Melt the butter in the pot over medium heat and add the mirepoix. Use the vegetables to try and pick up the fond 
	from the bottom of the pot if you seared meat in it earlier. Once the vegetables become fragrant, sprinkle in a spoonful of flour and season with cayenne powder and thyme. 
	When mixed with butter, the flour will become a roux. This paste-like substance is often used to thicken soups and sauces. The more flour, the more starch, the thicker the soup. 
	Roux must be cooked through unless you want your soup tasting like raw flour. For this recipe, let the roux come to a blond color. The darker the roux gets, the less thick the 
	soup, but the more flavor it adds. In Cajun cooking, it is common to cook roux until it reaches the color of peanut butter or even chocolate to add an earthy, nutty flavor. 
	However, when making bechamel sauce, the roux should remain white in order to keep the sauce as thick and creamy as possible. For a soup, you want it thicker than water but 
	thinner than a sauce. Because we want to get some of that nutty flavor, we slightly toast the roux until it becomes blond. but we don’t go further, since we want to retain its 
	thickening power when using such a small amount of flour.
	</p>
	<p class="story">
	Once the roux is blond and has taken on a toasted smell, the thyme should be fragrant and the mirepoix should be cooked properly. That’s the time to add the water. 
	There’s a saying I heard from Chef John from Food Wishes: hot roux, cold milk, no lumps. Of course, in this case, we’re using water instead of milk, but the principle stands. 
	To avoid your soup from becoming lumpy, stream in cold water slowly, stirring as you go to dissolve the roux. The amount of water depends entirely on how much soup you want. 
	If any fond still remains on the pot, take this opportunity to make sure it gets dissolved into the soup. Bring it to a boil and add the meat or other vegetables you wanted to 
	add. Cover, turn down the heat, and simmer for about 10-15 minutes to cook the newly added ingredients. Go at least 15 minutes if using meat to ensure it cooks fully. 
	This will also allow the starch molecules in the roux to take on the water and thicken the soup.
	</p>
	<p class="story">
	 At this point, uncover the soup and bring back up to a boil. Shake off as much excess flour from the noodles as possible and add them to the pot along with the minced garlic. 
	 I like adding garlic at the end of a soup to get a fresher flavor, but some people like the sauteed garlic flavor better. If that’s the case, add the garlic with the mirepoix 
	 instead. Or if you’re a serious garlic-head, double the amount of garlic and add one half at the beginning and one at the end. Boil for 1-2 minutes until the pasta comes to 
	 an al dente stage. Because the pasta is fresh, it won’t need to cook longer. Taste the soup, season with salt and pepper to taste, and turn off the heat. Keep in mind that 
	 you’ll need a lot of salt, since we didn’t use any thus far. Soup is often best seasoned closer to the end to get the amount of salt just right.
	</p>
	<p class="story">
	Serve the soup, making sure to get a little bit of everything in each bowl. Drizzle a glug of olive oil over the top and enjoy. The only ingredients I listed are a mirepoix, roux, 
	garlic, a couple basic seasonings, olive oil, noodles, and water. Very simple, but this is just the bare essentials. In the past, I’ve added things like mushrooms, peas, 
	ground turkey, chicken breast, and bell peppers, depending on what I had in the kitchen at the time. Feel free to experiment with the ingredients according to your tastes, 
	including the herbs and spices. Make it your own and make it good.

	Despite how much I love to cook, I sometimes give in to the easy way of making dinner by throwing a tray of chicken nuggets in the oven. But even a simple comfort meal can be 
	enhanced greatly through something like making your own version of Raising Cane’s signature sauce right at home. I found this recipe online, and while it isn’t an exact match,

	<p class="story">
	Mix half a cup of mayo, a quarter cup of ketchup, half a teaspoon of garlic salt, half a teaspoon of black pepper, and a quarter teaspoon of Worcestershire sauce in a bowl. 
	I like going a little heavy on the garlic and adding a pinch of cayenne. That’s the advantage of making it at home: you get to customize it to your liking. I’ve heard that

	<h4 class="subtitle has-text-centered is-4">Story Time</h4>
	<p class="story">
	I’m one of the best cooks my friends know, but I’m the worst cook in my family. That’s why it’s a delight when they let me help out in the kitchen. I remember once, during 
	Thanksgiving, we split up different tasks. I was in charge of roasted brussels sprouts and cranberry sauce. Of course, I wasn’t planning on serving brussels sprouts alone, 
	so I had the idea to make an apple cider gastrique. A gastrique is basically a combination of caramel and vinegar of some kind, which creates a sweet and sour sauce that goes 
	well with scallops, roasted vegetables, and much more. This is based on a couple recipes I found online with some minor modifications.
	</p>
	<p class="story">
	Start by pouring the sugar and water into a small saucepan and bring it to a simmer. It may be tempting to stir, but don’t. It will cause the caramel to harden, and we want it 
	to remain liquid. In the microwave, heat up the apple cider vinegar. It doesn’t need to be simmering, just make sure it is above room temperature. Caramelizing sugar is 
	incredibly hot, so if you splash a bunch of cool liquid in it, it’ll start bubbling and splattering boiling sugar everywhere, which will be immensely painful if it gets on you. 
	Keep a good watch over the caramel. Caramel goes from brown to burnt in a matter of seconds if you’re not careful. Once the desired color is achieved (around a maple syrup 
	color), turn off the heat.
	</p>
	<p class="story">
	CAREFULLY pour in the hot vinegar. Put it back onto medium-high heat and stir until the sugar is fully dissolved. Throw in peppercorns and cinnamon stick if desired 
	(along with any other desired whole spices), and reduce the gastrique slightly. It should coat the back of a spoon and should have a slightly syrupy viscosity. Turn off the heat, 
	stir in a pinch of salt, and let cool for a few minutes. Strain out the spices using a fine mesh sieve. This is why we used a cinnamon stick and coarse pepper, so that the sieve 
	would be able to separate them, leaving you with a beautiful container of liquid gold. If you are averse to the pungency of apple cider vinegar, any cooking vinegar will do fine, 
	but you forgo the apple flavor. This was a hit at Thanksgiving and I wouldn’t shut up about how proud I was of making something so fancy, much to my family’s annoyance.

	My family has tried to make cranberry sauce on Thanksgiving many times, and I always found it too sour or too spicy. When I was put in charge of making it, I made sure it was 
	the perfect recipe. Full disclosure, I don’t remember where I got this recipe from, but I definitely stole it off the internet somewhere for your enjoyment.
	</p>
	<p class="story">
	The best advice I can give is to listen to the Cranberries while making cranberry sauce. I swear it makes the flavor ten times better. Put all the ingredients in a saucepan, 
	except the orange and the water. For the orange, you’ll want to zest it and then squeeze out all the juice into the saucepan. Then add the water and turn the heat up to medium 
	high, stirring occasionally until it begins to boil. Then simmer on low for 15 minutes. You’ll know when the cranberries are cooked because they will swell and burst when 
	pressed with your trusty wooden spoon.
	</p>
	<p class="story">
	Once it cools, serve it with whatever you like. Whether it’s Thanksgiving or National Eat A Cranberry Day (November 23) or you just wanted a nice sweet and sour treat, 
	this sauce is sure to put a smile on your face.

	<p class="story">
	You may have heard this recipe called by the name <em>chole</em>, usually served with a side of fried bread called <em>bhatura</em>. Whatever you call it, this North Indian 
	classic is packed with energy, flavor, and nutrition that is a guaranteed knockout for a simple yet filling weeknight meal.
	</p>
	<p class="story">
	Start by adding cumin seeds and a bay leaf to a pot with hot oil. This will wake up the flavor compounds in these ingredients. Of course, if you leave your spices frying too 
	long, you risk burning them, so make sure to add some finely diced onion when the cumin becomes fragrant and slightly toasted.
	</p>
	<p class="story">
	The onion is going to need to cook for a little while so you can mince your garlic, peel your ginger, and dice your tomato in the meantime. Make sure the onion doesn’t burn by 
	stirring the pot occasionally. You’ll know the onion is fully cooked when it becomes translucent and shrinks a bit due to water loss. You don’t want to caramelize or sear the 
	onion, just make sure they’re fully cooked. Once they’re at that stage, grate in some ginger, add the minced garlic with the tomatoes, then sprinkle in a pinch of salt. The 
	salt will help release moisture and break down the vegetables faster. Once all the ingredients are well-mixed, Add all the rest of the spices. The coriander, cumin, cinnamon, 
	and cloves are common ingredients in garam masala that will give a lot of flavor and warmth to the chana. Then add a bit of paprika for color and cayenne powder to taste.
	</p>
	<p class="story">
	Mix the ingredients together well, making sure to mash the tomato up as much as possible. The spices will combine with the tomato and create a paste-like substance that will act 
	as the base for our gravy. Let the paste continue to reduce so that it deepens in flavor and the spices have a chance to cook properly. You’ll be able to tell that the spices 
	are done cooking when the oil begins to leak out. The paste will have a noticeable sheen and you’ll be able to see a little oil sizzling out at the edges of the paste. This 
	stage is critical, so don’t try to rush it. If you read my recipes for rajma and chicken tikka masala, you’ll notice a similar trend. Cooking down onion, tomato, and spices into 
	a paste and getting to this leaking-oil stage before adding water. Congratulations, you just discovered the quintessential technique for making a good curry. By mastering this 
	technique, you’ll unlock the ability to make a plethora of Indian dishes and even make your own curry recipe if you want.
	</p>
	<p class="story">
	Add 2 cups of chickpeas and half as much water once the spices are done cooking. I like using drained, canned chickpeas for this recipe, despite the reduction in flavor. I find 
	that it’s far easier than soaking the chickpeas overnight and having to cook them for longer. Plus, the can is a great way to measure out the amount of water you need as well. 
	Mix and bring up to a simmer. Continue to simmer with the lid on for 5-10 minutes. You want the chickpeas to soften and absorb as much flavor as possible. Take off the lid and 
	mash some of the chickpeas against the sides of the pot to help thicken the gravy. Adjust for seasoning, then serve with bhature, naan, or rice. Top with chopped cilantro 
	leaves, raw red onion slices, or both.

	<h4 class="subtitle has-text-centered is-4">Story Time</h4>
	<p class="story">
	Perhaps one of the simplest dishes, but a certified crowd-pleaser nonetheless. There’s some little tips and tricks here that will revolutionize your sandwich making skills, 
	so pay attention and don’t skip a single step.
	</p>
	<p class="story">
	First slice your tomato into even slices, about a centimeter thick. Too thin, and there’s no point in calling it a tomato melt. Too thick, and it’ll slide right out. 
	Grate the cheese in advance and keep it to the side. I like using a 50-50 blend of sharp cheddar for the flavor, and Monterey jack because it melts very well. 
	Feel free to use any cheese you like, as long as you can shred it and it will melt. Smoked gouda, pepperjack, or low-moisture mozzarella might be worth a try.
	</p>
	<p class="story">
	When it comes to toasting the bread, most people use butter. Some use olive oil. The true culinary wizards know that mayonnaise is the key to a perfect grilled sandwich. 
	Before you turn up your nose at the idea of this, think about what mayo is made of. Oil and egg yolk. This fatty mixture with a smoke point higher than butter will allow 
	you to get the perfect crispy crust on your toast. Furthermore, it is far easier to evenly spread mayo on bread than butter or olive oil. There are also small amounts of 
	spices and flavorings in mayo that will provide just the lightest oomph of flavor to elevate your sandwich to the next level. If you don’t like the taste or texture of mayo, 
	don’t worry! It doesn’t even taste like mayo because we use such a small amount and it all gets toasted. So go ahead and spread a thin layer of mayonnaise on one side of each 
	slice of bread. I like using multigrain whole wheat bread, but any sliced sandwich bread should be fine.
	</p>
	<p class="story">
	Toast the bread mayo-side-down over medium-high heat. Once golden brown, flip over and add the grated cheese to both slices. Always add more cheese than you think you’ll need. 
	When it melts, it seems like a lot less than what you put down. It’s okay if some strands of cheese spill off the bread and start sizzling. Those will become little brown, 
	lacy, crunchy, delicious cheese crisps that will add a lot of flavor to the sandwich. Just make sure to move around the bread a little to pick up all of those crunchy bits. 
	Lower the heat to medium-low to prevent the bread from burning and wait for the cheese to melt. It might help to cover the skillet with a lid to speed up the process.
	</p>
	<p class="story">
	Put a layer of tomatoes on one of the slices, and try to cover as much surface area as possible. You might have to cut up a slice or two of the tomatoes to get it to fit. 
	Now for the most important part: SEASON YOUR TOMATOES! Nothing crazy, just some salt and pepper, but this makes such a big difference. That’s most likely why so many people 
	are averse to tomatoes in sandwiches. Without seasoning, they’re bland, moist pucks that take up space in your sandwich. But with just a sprinkle of salt, all the natural 
	flavors in the tomato are brought to the surface: a surge of sweet, sour, and umami, all from one simple ingredient. Don’t ever let me catch you making a sandwich using 
	unseasoned tomatoes ever again.
	</p>
	<p class="story">
	Close the sandwich and press gently to glue the cheese onto the tomato. Continue to toast either side of the sandwich until the bread is fully toasted. Also, a hot cheese 
	sandwich with cold tomato is a bit weird, so this will also give time for the tomato to warm through. Cut diagonally (if you cut your sandwich any other way, don’t talk to me) 
	and serve. I originally made this because I wanted a grilled cheese but I also needed at least one vegetable with my meal. Upon eating this, I felt warmed to my soul, 
	and it became a staple meal during my college years. It took me 2 years to realize it felt so comforting because it tastes like tomato soup and grilled cheese all in one 
	sandwich. Such a simple and cheap meal, but so unbelievably good.

	<p class="story">
	My mom was too tired to make dinner one night, so she asked me to do it. I asked if a sandwich was okay and she agreed. I looked in the fridge and improvised. The result was 
	so good, my mom said it was the best sandwich I ever made.
	</p>
	<p class="story">
	Drizzle olive oil in a hot pan and toast 2 slices of sourdough. Once the bread is toasted, turn off the heat and let cool on a wire rack. While the pan cools off, mash up 
	an avocado in a bowl along with some salt, pepper, and a squeeze of lime juice. Spread the avocado mixture onto both sides of the bread. If you have guacamole on hand, 
	that’s an acceptable substitute as well. Add a few tablespoons of olive oil to the pan and heat over medium. Crack an egg into the hot pan and season it by putting salt on the 
	whites and garlic powder on the yolk. The salt will help the whites set properly, and the garlic will pack the yolk with flavor. Flip over the egg, taking care not to break 
	the yolk. Immediately add cheese over it to ensure it melts as soon as possible. I like using a pre-shredded Mexican 4 cheese blend, but you can also use shredded low-moisture 
	mozzarella instead. Cover with a lid until the cheese melts and add some red pepper flakes over the cheese. You can cook your egg to desired doneness, but I prefer over medium. 
	I like having a runny yolk, but thick enough that it doesn’t feel raw.
	</p>
	<p class="story">
	When the egg is done, place the egg on one slice of bread, top with some leaves of baby spinach, and then close the sandwich. I always slice my sandwich in half before serving. 
	If you leave your eggs a little runny like me, you'll be fortunate enough to see the yolk oozing out as you cut into it. Marvelous.

	<p class="story">
	Sausage, peppers, and onions. A classic combination in Italian cooking, and for good reason. But stir fried with bacon grease and soy sauce, then served over rice? 
	A game changer for sure.
	</p>
	<p class="story">
	Start by cooking your rice in a pot. While you’re waiting on the rice, slice up the onion and bell pepper thinly and mince the garlic. Stir fry the onion in a skillet over 
	high heat with red pepper flakes in bacon grease if you have it. If not, olive oil is fine. The trick to stir fry is stirring it as you fry it. Sounds tautological, sure, 
	but seriously, stir frying is all about using high heat to cook quickly, so keep it moving so you don’t burn anything. Once the onion becomes translucent, add the peppers and 
	garlic, along with a sprinkle of salt and a hefty shake or two of paprika. 
	</p>
	<p class="story">
	Slice up the sausages into coins. I prefer using Italian sausage or smoked sausage, but any sausage will do. When the onion and bell pepper both start getting slightly browned, 
	add the sausage and stir fry for 1-2 minutes to get some color on the sausages. Cover with a lid and cook on low heat for 5 minutes. Uncover, stir in a small amount of oregano 
	and a large amount of black pepper, then put the lid back on for another 5 minutes.
	</p>
	<p class="story">
	Stir a splash of soy sauce into the rice, which should have finished cooking by now. Make sure every grain of rice has some color on it. Turn off the heat on the skillet and 
	pour the sausagepeppers&onions onto the rice. Make sure to use a clump of rice to mop up all the oil and stray bits of flavor left in the skillet so everything makes it into 
	the rice. Mix thoroughly and serve with sliced scallions as a garnish.

	<!-- About the recipe -->
	<h4 class="subtitle has-text-centered is-4">Story Time</h4>
	<p class="story">
	There’s only 2 foods I’ve ever cooked that made it impossible for me to stop smiling while eating them. Gumbo and gnocchi. These tender potato dumplings are excellent with 
	tomato sauce, but the recipe I have here is for a traditional sage and brown butter sauce. This recipe is by Stephen Cusato of Not Another Cooking Show.
	</p>
	<p class="story">
	First, preheat the oven to 350F. We’re using baked potatoes rather than boiled to avoid excess moisture. Moisture + flour = gluten = chewy. We want soft and tender, not tough 
	and chewy. Stab your potatoes with a fork so that they can vent steam, and sprinkle them with salt. Bake on a foil-lined baking tray for at least 90 minutes. The potatoes 
	should meet absolutely no resistance when stabbed with a knife. You can even let them go for a full 2 hours, as long as the potatoes are as soft as possible on the inside. 
	Take out the potatoes when done, then peel and grate them onto a clean countertop.
	</p>
	<p class="story">
	Fold in a beaten egg and most of the flour using a bench scraper. Gradually fold in flour gently, taking care not to knead it, until a smooth ball can be formed and the dough 
	is no longer sticky. Remember, the less you work the dough, the more tender the gnocchi will be. Roll out the dough with your fingers into a snake about the width of your 
	finger. Try spreading your fingers as you roll to help stretch out the dough into the snake shape. Cut the snake into inch-long pieces, and roll the pieces into balls. 
	Place a fork upside down and coat in flour. Roll the dough balls over the back of the fork. This will curl the dumplings into a pill bug shape and create ridges on the back 
	which will be great for clinging onto the sauce.
	</p>
	<p class="story">
	Now for the brown butter sage sauce. Start boiling a pot of water and melt some butter in a separate pan. Cook the butter over medium-high until it becomes toasty and browned, 
	but not burnt. If you blacken it, you need to start the sauce over. Add some fresh sage leaves to the butter and turn down the heat to prevent burning. Cook until sage begins 
	to become crispy and turn off the heat. By now the pot of water should be boiling. Boil the gnocchi for a few minutes. They’re done cooking when they begin to float. 
	Add the gnocchi to the brown butter sage sauce along with a splash of the cooking water. That water is now laden with starch, which will thicken the sauce and help it stick to 
	the gnocchi. Cook gnocchi in the sauce on medium heat until sauce thickens slightly and gnocchi gets a little color. Make sure to keep the contents of the pan moving to 
	emulsify the sauce with the water. Serve and top with grated parmesan.

	<h4 class="subtitle has-text-centered is-4">Story Time</h4>
	<p class="story">
	I created this dish when I used to work out regularly to help me bulk. Heavy on protein, carbs, and fat to help you meet your macros. Heavy on flavor so you could eat 
	it every day and never tire of it. Of course, feel free to omit the eggs if you don't care for the taste or don't need the extra protein and fat. Don't be afraid to make it 
	your own. I sometimes add things like green bell pepper, carrots, or celery, depending on what's in the fridge.
	</p>
	<p class="story">
	While you wait for your rice to cook, put some olive oil, cayenne, turmeric, cumin seed, and mustard seed into a pan over medium heat. These are traditional Indian flavors, 
	and although this dish is not at all Indian, I’m glad I was able to use my knowledge of Indian cuisine to help me in inventing new dishes. Next, mince the garlic and dice the 
	onion. When the mustard seeds begin popping, that’s when you know the spices are properly toasted. Add the onions and garlic, then turn the heat to medium-low. Once the onions
	begin to sweat, Add the ground turkey. Break up the turkey as much as possible and season with salt. Most people complain that turkey is too dry, but the little juicy nuggets 
	of meat in this dish do everything except disappoint. Next, dice up mushroom and tomato, then add them to the mix with some salt and pepper. Because these ingredients contain a 
	lot of water, they are key in preventing the turkey from drying out. Once the mushrooms lose some of their water, cover with a lid for 2 minutes. This will allow the tomatoes to 
	release all their moisture without it all evaporating away. Take off the lid and stir. 
	</p>
	<p class="story">
	Make 3 spaces in the pan and crack eggs into them. Scramble the eggs, mix everything together, and turn off the heat. The eggs should be fully cooked, but there should still 
	be a lot of liquid in the pan from the tomato. Fold the contents of the pan into the rice until the turmeric stains every grain of rice yellow. I call this process reverse 
	colonization, because we don't want any white remaining. Scoop into a plate or bowl and serve. This dish is very heavy in protein and carbs, making it a great 
	option for people trying to gain muscle without eating just bland chicken and plain rice. This dish has nutrients. This dish has spices. This dish nourishes. This dish satisfies.

	<!-- About the recipe -->
	<h4 class="subtitle has-text-centered is-4">Story Time</h4>
	<p class="story">
	I found this recipe for chicken on TikTok. The person who made the video put mayo, salt, pepper, parmesan, and minced garlic on some chicken breasts and baked them in the oven. 
	I tried out the recipe and although it tasted great, it was missing something. A lot of things, actually. First of all, where’s the spices? You think salt and pepper count as 
	spices? That’s the bare minimum. Second, this is all just protein covered in fat. There’s not a vegetable or complex carbohydrate in sight. No, if I were to make this recipe 
	again, I’d have to do better.
	</p>
	<p class="story">
	I opted to use boneless and skinless chicken thighs instead of breasts for their flavor and texture. I made sure to salt them well on both sides first, and mixed the mayo with 
	the garlic and some herbs and spices in a separate bowl. The herbs and spices consisted of a heavy shake each of paprika, freshly ground black pepper, thyme, and rosemary 
	followed a small shake each of oregano and cayenne. Now <em>that’s</em> what I call seasoning. I also opted out of using the parmesan since I had recently run out, but feel 
	free to add it if you want. When making the mayo marinade, only use enough mayo to fully coat the chicken, so as to avoid waste or drowning the chicken mayo.
	</p>
	<p class="story">
	Preheat your oven to 400F and prepare a foil-lined baking sheet. Smear the marinade all over the thighs (the chicken’s, not yours) and make sure all the little crevices are 
	completely covered. Once every inch of the chicken is properly dressed, lay them flat onto the baking sheet and add any leftover marinade on top. Bake for 30 minutes.
	</p>
	<p class="story">
	While waiting for that, now is the perfect time to make your cola stir-fry and rice. You read that right, we’re using cola in the stir-fry. Start by cooking a pot of rice. In 
	the meantime, slice the onion and bell pepper thinly. Cook the onions in a pan with vegetable oil and red pepper flakes over high heat. Once they become slightly fragrant, add 
	the minced garlic and bell pepper with a pinch of salt. Keep the vegetables moving so they don’t burn. Once you get a bit of a char on the onion and bell peppers, add ground 
	ginger, oregano, and paprika. Mix well to wake up the spices, then throw in a splash of soy sauce.
	</p>
	<p class="story">
	Reduce and cook down for 1-2 minutes until the vegetables absorb the flavor, then add the coke along with some black pepper. You might find it strange, but I think it works 
	very well. Coke is high in sugar and acidity, so by reducing it, you can easily make your own sweet and sour sauce. And it’s not too overwhelming either, most of the cola 
	flavor dissipates as it cooks, so it actually blends in quite nicely. I got the idea when I saw some recipes for steak with a cola-based marinade that had soy sauce in it. 
	The cola will reduce to the point where it coats the back of a spoon and a line can be drawn through it. That means it’s good to go. Add it over your rice and mix well to 
	distribute the flavor. Adjust seasoning as necessary.
	</p>
	<p class="story">
	Chances are, your stir-fry will be done before the chicken. That’s okay, just put a lid on the rice and wait for the chicken to be done. To be safe, check if the thighs are hot 
	enough (the chicken’s not yours) by inserting a meat thermometer into the thickest part of the chicken. It should clock in at 160F for safe consumption. If it’s too low, let it 
	keep cooking until it reaches the target temp. I find that the marinade and the short cooking time keep the chicken relatively moist even when fully cooked. Serve the chicken 
	beside the rice on a plate and enjoy. I personally like using a fork to shred up one bite of chicken at a time and eat it with a forkful of rice and vegetables. Now, is this 
	recipe healthy? Goodness no, I hope you gave up on that the second I told you to rub chicken thighs with mayonnaise. But is it good? Oh you bet.

	<h4 class="subtitle has-text-centered is-4">Story Time</h4>
	<p class="story">
	I’m not really a baking guy, I’m a cooking guy. Baking requires precision, while cooking is more forgiving with improvisation. Because I tend to favor flexibility in the 
	kitchen, I’m a decent cook, but a terrible baker. That being said, I wanted to try baking a dessert when I had just started cooking, and I’m the type of person to go big 
	or go home. So I settled on lemon meringue pie. The first time I made it was horrible. Our springform pan was too big, so I had to triple the recipe, and I ended up forgetting 
	to triple some of the ingredients. As a result, the meringue wasn’t stiff, the curd hadn’t set, and the graham cracker crust just tasted all wrong. But I learned my lesson. 
	I started by learning to make a pate brisee, none of this graham cracker business. If you’re making a pie, at least use a pie dish and a proper pie crust. Second, people 
	complained that there was too much meringue, so I had to reduce that. In doing research, I found that the recipe I used called for whole eggs in the curd, while some opted 
	for just the yolks. That’s where I had an idea: Create the perfect lemon meringue pie recipe with no leftover whites or yolks. And that’s exactly what I did. This is one of the 
	first recipes I engineered on my own and I must say, I’m quite proud of it.
	</p>
	<p class="story">
	There are 3 main components to a lemon meringue pie. Crust, lemon curd, and meringue. The three of these work together in perfect harmony to create a perfect dessert. 
	It can even show us a lesson in rhetoric, if you replace these components with Ethos, Logos, and Pathos. This rhetorical triangle, proposed by Aristotle, illustrates the 3 main 
	components of rhetoric. Ethos is authority: to deliver a strong message you must be credible. Logos is logic: to deliver a sound message you must use factual arguments. 
	Pathos is emotion: to deliver a moving message you must appeal to the emotions of your audience. Many people fail to deliver messages because they leave the rhetorical triangle 
	incomplete. For instance, scientists can’t convince people of facts because they are trained only to use Ethos and Logos. Without Pathos, who will listen to reason? 
	All three are equally important in rhetoric, just as crust, curd, and meringue are equally important in a lemon meringue pie.
	</p>
	<p class="story">
	The crust is like Ethos: it provides definition and stability. Without it, the pie wouldn’t hold up and people would question if it even counts as a pie anymore. The lemon curd 
	is like Logos, because people mistakenly assume it matters more than the other components. But it’s so bright and tart that an audience would find it unpleasant to experience on 
	its own. That’s why it must be balanced with meringue, which is like Pathos. The swirling, toasted peaks and delicate sweetness make the pie a true work of art and offset the 
	sourness of the curd. Together, this culinary rhetorical triangle works to create a harmonious, delicious experience. Now, enough about rhetoric, let’s make some pie.
	</p>
	<p class="story">
	Start with the crust. This recipe makes enough dough for 2 pie crusts on a standard 9-inch pie dish. The most important thing when making pie crust is to keep it COLD. 
	Warmth will melt the butter, which is bad because we want little chunks of butter in the dough to melt in the oven. That way, the water in the butter evaporates and creates 
	little steam pockets, while the fat in the butter crisps up the edges of those pockets. When you have layers of these little crispy air pockets, that’s called a flaky crust. 
	It’s a similar principle to making croissants. In addition, by keeping the crust cold, you prevent water in the dough from evaporating too quickly in the oven, which would 
	otherwise cause the crust to shrink as it bakes. I prefer making my dough the night before I want pie. This allows me to work in a cool environment and give me plenty of time 
	to rest the dough while I sleep.
	</p>
	<p class="story">
	Because we want everything to be cold, start by refrigerating your flour and salt in a mixing bowl. In the meantime, cube up some cold butter and put it in the freezer. When 
	everything is cooled down, after about 30 minutes, take out the dry mixture and butter. Put the butter in the flour and begin using your hands to coat the cubes and break them 
	apart (if you have a handheld pastry blender, refrigerate ahead of time and use that instead). The idea here is not to fully mix the butter and flour together. We want to 
	instead break the butter up into pea-sized chunks and coat them in the flour. Make sure to use your fingers and not palms, as the warmth of your hands may melt the butter too 
	much. When the butter is cut into the flour properly, that’s the time to start adding the water.
	</p>
	<p class="story">
	Just like everything else, the water should have ice in it and should be refrigerated ahead of time. Add a small amount of water at a time and mix it into the dough. Avoid 
	kneading the dough as much as possible, as kneading will develop the gluten and form a chewy crust. Stop adding water when you are able to clump the dough into a shaggy mass. 
	Use as little water as possible. You may not even need all the water, depending on the moisture in the air. All these steps are to ensure that the dough shrinks as little as 
	possible and produces a flaky, delicate crust. Work the dough (as little as possible) until you can shape it into a ball. You’ll notice that the dough is dry, held weakly 
	together, has visible bits of butter streaking through, and it cracks easily when squished. That’s exactly what you want. Cover the dough tightly in plastic wrap and 
	freeze overnight.
	</p>
	<p class="story">
	The next day, cut the dough in half, wrap up the half you aren’t going to use and place back in the freezer. This should be good for at least another 4 months. It’s an excellent 
	all-purpose crust dough, you can use it in pies, tarts, quiches, etc. Let the half you are using thaw on a clean work surface. You want it to remain cold, but still be more 
	workable than a block of ice. Dust the surface and a rolling pin with flour and roll out the dough evenly until it is about 2 inches wider than the outside rim of the pie dish. 
	Now grease your pie dish with some butter and dust with a thin layer of flour. This will ensure an easy release from the dish every single time without fail. Place the dough in 
	the dish and gently fit it into all the edges, taking care not to stretch out or squish the dough too much. Trim off any excess hanging off the side and crimp the edges of the 
	dough so it rests nicely on the rim of the pie dish. Now take a fork and stab a whole bunch of holes all over the sides and bottom of the dough. This is called “docking” and it 
	will prevent any large air bubbles from puffing up the dough too much. Place the pie dish in the freezer for at least 30 minutes while you heat up the oven to 350F. When the 
	oven is ready, place pie weights in your pie crust. If you don’t have pie weights, you can just use nuts or dry beans on a layer of tinfoil instead. These will ensure that 
	the pie doesn’t puff up, in the event that the docking doesn’t do the trick. Place in the center of the oven, take it out after 20 minutes, remove the foil and pie weights, 
	and resume baking until golden brown (maybe another 15-30 minutes).
	</p>
	<p class="story">
	While you let the finished crust cool off by a windowsill, Juice and zest 2-3 lemons (depending on size) into a mixing bowl (preferably glass or metal). Add 2 egg yolks and 
	1 whole egg to the bowl. Leave the 2 remaining egg whites at room temperature in a clean, dry, cool, bowl made of metal or glass. These whites will be needed to make the 
	meringue, and any moisture, dirt, oil, plastic, soap, etc. will prevent the meringue from whipping to stiff peaks. Add cornstarch and sugar to the lemon mixture, then whisk 
	over a double boiler until smooth. Melt in butter one cube at a time. Adding too many at once will cool down the mixture too fast and make it harder to melt. Make sure to 
	whisk constantly. Do not stop even for 5 seconds, or else you risk scrambling the eggs in the curd. Once all the butter is fully incorporated, you can test if the curd is 
	ready by dipping the back of a spoon in it. If it coats the back of a spoon and a clear line can be drawn through it with your finger, it’s ready. Pour it into the crust, 
	cover with plastic wrap, making sure the plastic makes contact with the surface of the curd, and refrigerate it for 30 minutes. Keeping the plastic wrap in contact with the 
	curd prevents it from forming a skin on the surface.
	</p>
	<p class="story">
	While waiting for the curd to set, make the meringue using the 2 egg whites from before. Add a splash of white vinegar and whip until very frothy. The vinegar will help to 
	stabilize the structure of the meringue. Please avoid making a meringue using a handheld whisk. I’ve tried it and it took forever. I thought my wrist would fall off. 
	Use a stand mixer or an electric mixer if you have it. Once the whites are frothed up, begin gently sprinkling in the sugar. Too fast and it will deflate the meringue. 
	Too slow and it won’t all dissolve in time. Add it very gradually and always keep whipping. Once all the sugar has been added, continue whipping until it reaches a stiff peaks 
	stage. This means that if you dip a whisk in the meringue and hold it up, you should see a peak of meringue on the whisk. If the tip of the peak is floppy, it’s soft peaks. 
	If it points up, then it’s stiff peaks. If it looks puffy, you’ve over-beaten it by shearing the proteins too much and you need to start over.
	</p>
	<p class="story">
	Take the plastic off of your lemon curd and gently place the meringue on top using a spatula. Use a fork to create swirls and peaks, this is the time to really get creative. 
	Then use a pastry torch to toast the top of the meringue. It should be browned, but not blackened. If you’re like me and you don’t have a pastry torch, set the rack in your 
	oven to the highest placement and set it to broil. Once it’s preheated, add your pie to the top rack and watch carefully as the meringue toasts. This will take only 
	30-60 seconds, so keep the oven light on and watch it at all times. Now look upon the culinary beauty you’ve created. Hours of work, philosophical perfection.

	<!-- About the recipe -->
	<h4 class="subtitle has-text-centered is-4">Story Time</h4>
	<p class="story">
	I originally created this recipe as part of a recipe for apple turnovers, but those turned out horrible. The filling was still good though, so I reworked it to be a stovetop 
	apple filling that would go great with vanilla ice cream, French toast, etc.
	</p>
	<p class="story">
	Peel and core the apples, then cut them into half-inch cubes. I like using honeycrisp apples for their sweetness, but you can use whatever you want. If you prefer a tart apple, 
	granny smiths work very well, though you’ll need to add more sugar to your taste. Melt the butter in a pan over medium heat. Make sure to keep the butter moving as you melt it, 
	so as to avoid breaking the natural emulsion of fat and water in the butter. Add in your apple pieces along with some sugar and a pinch of salt. Stir until the sugar dissolves 
	and continue to cook until the butter begins to brown and the sugar begins to caramelize.
	</p>
	<p class="story">
	Add the water along with a small squeeze of lemon juice. You can even add a bit of lemon zest if you like, but I find it unnecessary. Adding lemon juice will help the natural 
	pectin in the apples thicken the liquid to make a gorgeous, golden-brown, syrupy sauce. Once the water comes to a simmer and begins to thicken, add the vanilla extract and 
	the spices. Cinnamon and ginger, supplemented with a bit of nutmeg and allspice, will bring that classic, warm pumpkin-spice smell we all associate with autumn flavors. 
	Continue cooking until the sauce becomes syrupy and the apples are softened all the way through. Now you have the essence of an apple pie in your hands. Do with it 
	what you will, but remember: with great flavor comes great responsibility.

	<h4 class="subtitle has-text-centered is-4">Story Time</h4>
	<p class="story">
	I originally made this recipe to act as a topping for French toast, but you can use it however you like. This recipe starts with a banana, preferably on the slightly green side, 
	so that it doesn’t become too mushy. Peel the banana and slice it on a bias. You could slice it straight, but it looks so much cooler when you’ve cut it at an angle.
	</p>
	<p class="story">
	Put some sugar in a dry pan over medium high heat with half a tablespoon of water sprinkled around the outside. It may be tempting to stir, but don’t. You’ll make it into rock 
	candy and we want caramel. Keep an eye on the sugar as it melts. Not only is it fun to watch, but you need to keep track of the color because sugar can go from caramel to 
	burnt mess very fast. That’s why the water is on the outside, to prevent the edges from burning too fast. Right before the sugar reaches a dark amber color, turn the heat to 
	low and add the rest of the water, about a tablespoon and a half. Add the butter and a pinch of salt. Only now begin stirring it to melt in the butter. Add the vanilla extract 
	and the banana slices. Turn the heat back up to medium high and reduce slightly. Make sure to flip the bananas while cooking to get even covering of caramel. Don’t cook for too 
	long or the bananas will become mush. Take off the heat and serve on top of the breakfast or dessert of your choice.
	</p>
	<p class="story">
	Truth be told, this recipe hasn’t been perfected yet. I still get hard pieces of caramel in the sauce, but I’m hoping to work it out eventually. Despite that, I put this work 
	in progress on the website, because it still tastes good regardless. Soft pieces of banana coated in a sweet, slightly banana-flavored caramel sauce. Even if it isn’t perfect, 
	it’s still pretty great and I stand by that.

	<h4 class="subtitle has-text-centered is-4">Story Time</h4>
	<p class="story">
	This is kind of like an Indian version of carrot cake. I’m not the biggest fan of it, but my friend wanted to know how to make it so I wrote down my mom’s recipe. As you can 
	see, a lot of the recipe is based on feel rather than exact timings, so without experience, it’s difficult to gauge. I’ve never even made this recipe myself, but it would 
	still be fun to try.
	</p>
	<p class="story">
	Start by heating up ghee in a large pot. Ghee (also known as clarified butter) is just butter with the milk solids separated out through cooking. It has a slightly nuttier 
	taste, a more unctuous texture, and is a staple in Indian cooking. Next, add the cashews and raisins and cook until the raisins are plump and the cashews develop a little color. 
	Remove the cashews and raisins, but keep the ghee in there, because we need to cook down the carrots in it. The name gajar halwa means carrot halwa in Hindi (halwa being a 
	dessert common in west, central, and south Asia). I’ve opted to call it gajar halwa instead of carrot halwa on this website because it’s my mother’s recipe and that 
	pronunciation is true to what I called it when I was growing up.
	</p>
	<p class="story">
	Cook the carrots in the ghee on medium heat for 4-5 minutes, coating every piece of carrot in it. Then add a cup and a half of whole milk. Don’t use skim, you need the milkfat 
	in there. Milk boils over really fast and scorched milk is a big problem, so be sure to occasionally stir it. Eventually, the carrots will absorb the milk after about 
	15-20 minutes. When this happens, stir in the sugar and keep cooking for another 15 minutes. Stir in some milk powder and turn off the flame. I have no idea why we need 
	milk powder despite adding over a cup of milk, maybe just to get more milk per unit of milk. I think I’m just milking the joke at this point.
	</p>
	<p class="story">
	Crush up some cardamom pods into a powder and stir it in along with the fried cashews and raisins from the beginning. You didn’t forget about those, did you? Refrigerate the 
	halwa, preferably overnight. Serve at room temperature and enjoy.

	<!-- About the recipe -->
	<h4 class="subtitle has-text-centered is-4">Story Time</h4>
	<p class="story">
	I got this recipe while binging a bunch of Food Wishes videos on YouTube. I decided to make it, since it looked fancy, but I didn’t have any marsala wine. At the time, I was 
	underage, so I had no way to buy a bottle anyway. Determined to make the dish regardless, I found that citrus juice could be an acceptable substitute. So I made this 
	non-alcoholic zabaglione, and I must say, it is as wonderful to eat as it is to say.
	</p>
	<p class="story">
	First prepare the strawberries that will sit under your zabaglione by dicing them up and tossing them in a bowl with a bit of sugar. By tossing it in sugar and letting it sit, 
	you let the strawberries macerate, which means the sugar will break them down a little to release moisture and they will become nice and soft. This process will take an hour. 
	Just let it sit, but do give it a quick toss every once in a while.
	</p>
	<p class="story">
	Next, zest and juice one whole orange. You’ll need about a quarter cup of juice. Whisk the juice with the egg yolks and sugar in a bowl. Set over a double boiler and continue 
	to whisk until pale and thickened. Don’t stop whisking, because if the eggs heat up too quick, you’ll get scrambled egg. You know you’re done when you hold up the whisk and the 
	custard drips down in ribbons.
	</p>
	<p class="story">
	Use a whiskey glass or martini glass to serve. If you don’t have one, a cup will do fine. Start by putting in the strawberries, add a small layer of zest, then the custard over 
	top. Garnish with the remaining zest and serve. There’s so much sweetness in this dish that the bitterness of the zest does wonders for preventing your palate from being 
	bombarded with sugar. This dessert is the perfect blend of easy and fancy, and now you have a non-alcoholic version of the dish for those who can’t consume it.

	<p class="story">
	This recipe is directly taken from Binging with Babish. I like making this whenever I have leftover crepes after a big breakfast or brunch. Start by whisking eggs, water, milk, 
	butter, and salt. Whisk flour into the wet mixture until smooth. Let the batter rest for 30 minutes. This will relax the gluten and allow the flour to finish hydrating properly. 
	When ready, ladle the batter onto a skillet over medium heat and spread it thin. Cook until slightly browned, then flip and cook again until slightly browned on the other side. 
	This recipe will make a lot of crepes, but you really only need to save the 4 best ones to make crepes suzette. But what to do with the rest? Eat them, of course. Fill them 
	with Nutella, strawberries, condensed milk, sauteed mushrooms and cheese, I don’t care.
	</p>
	<p class="story">
	Now that you have your 4 remaining crepes set aside, melt the butter in a pan and dissolve the sugar in it. Mix in the zest and juice of 1 orange. When it comes to a simmer, 
	dip half a crepe in the sauce and fold it into quarters. Repeat the process with the 3 other crepes and fit them in the pan. Now you see why this recipe accommodates 4 crepes, 
	because each one is folded into a quarter of the size. Flip them after 1 minute and cook until they’re caramelized on the bottom.
	</p>
	<p class="story">
	Next step is the flambe. Be very careful here. Turn off the heat first, then add a splash of Grand Marnier. While the pan is NOT over the stove, turn the heat back on, 
	then gently put the pan back over. Alcohol is very flammable, so we want to control precisely when it gets set ablaze. If you have a gas stove, gently tilt the pan to the side 
	so some of the alcohol fumes catch on fire. Keep the flames away from you and continue gently shaking the pan until the alcohol burns out. If you have an electric stove, 
	try using a lighter, but still be incredibly cautious. If you’re too nervous about doing this, that’s totally okay, flambe is just for show. You can just cook out the alcohol 
	over the stove without setting the contents of the pan on fire. If you don’t consume alcohol, skip that step entirely. Serve on a plate with some vanilla ice cream and enjoy.

	I remember telling my friend about how I made a recipe for lemon meringue pie. He wanted to learn to make it, and in exchange for my recipe, he told me his mom’s special recipe 
	for sweet potato pie. Thank you George, and many thanks to your mom as well.
	</p>
	<p class="story">
	First start by boiling and peeling your sweet potato. You’ll know when it’s done boiling because you’ll be able to insert a fork or paring knife with no resistance. 
	Add the sweet potato to a bowl and mash slightly. Then add butter and mix well. Once that all comes together, stir in the rest of the ingredients and beat until smooth on 
	medium speed. Pour it into an unbaked pie crust and bake at 350F in the center of an oven for an hour or until a toothpick comes out clean.
	</p>
	<p class="story">
	I love sweet potato pie. I wish it was more popular, but even on Thanksgiving, most people overlook it in favor of pumpkin pie. Do give this dessert a chance, 
	it certainly deserves one.

	I’m gonna be completely honest. This recipe is garbage. If you want a chocolate cake, make a chocolate cake. This is far more dry, lacking in both flavor and texture. 
	It needs a scoop of ice cream to even be palatable. Someday I will make this recipe better, I just need to figure it out. But for now, I’m stuck with this. In any case, 
	nobody makes mug cakes for taste, it’s all for convenience.

	<p class="story">
	Combine flour, sugar, salt, cocoa powder, and baking powder in a microwave-safe mug. Once all your dry ingredients are together, add the milk, oil, and vanilla. 
	Mix well until smooth, then microwave for a minute. Serve with a scoop of your ice cream of choice. I like mint chocolate chip or vanilla with this recipe. I can promise it’ll be 
	fast, but as of right now, I can’t promise it’ll be any good.

	Don’t make that face. I know you read the ingredients. I know how you’re feeling. You think I’m crazy. You think I’ve lost it. You may be right. 
	All I ask is that you let me explain myself.
	</p>
	<p class="story">
	I was bored one day, in the summer of 2015. I went to the kitchen to make lunch and I improvised with whatever I had. I took 2 slices of sandwich bread. I used whole wheat, 
	but white bread would’ve worked fine. On one slice, I spread a layer of roasted garlic hummus. In a moment of blind curiosity, I spread Nutella on the other slice. 
	But my chaotic heart remained unsatisfied. It needed to be more cursed. I spread some yellow mustard over the hummus, making sure to use a thin layer, since it could overpower 
	the hummus in large quantities. I closed the sandwich and ate it. To my surprise, it was actually good. My only qualm was that it was very dry. After all, it was just a sandwich of only condiments. It needed something fresh, something juicy, like maybe… strawberries. The second time I made the sandwich (yes I ate this multiple times), I placed some sliced strawberries between the mustard and the Nutella. I took a bite and knew right away that I had nailed it. I told my family all about my proud invention while they fought the urge to gag.
	</p>
	<p class="story">
	Of course, it <em>sounds</em> bad, but because I’m the only one that has ever actually eaten it, I alone am left with the mystery: why does it taste so good? The ingredients 
	make no sense but somehow it just works. I think I figured it out. It’s like a cycle. Hummus and Nutella go together, and now many grocery stores actually sell chocolate hummus 
	as a popular item. Nutella and strawberries need no explanation as they are a classic pairing. Strawberries and mustard, while unconventional together, contain bright, acidic 
	notes that pair nicely with one another. Yellow mustard and hummus both have slightly bitter, earthy tastes from the turmeric and tahini respectively that make them work well 
	together, contrary to what one might imagine. This is a tangled web of flavor interactions, but it all somehow works out. I invite you to walk on the wild side and give this 
	unlikely hero a try.

	<!-- About the recipe -->
	<h4 class="subtitle has-text-centered is-4">Story Time</h4>
	<p class="story">
	Are you tired of making a gigantic feast at Thanksgiving? Wouldn’t you rather encapsulate the spirit of Thanksgiving all in one simple dish? What if I told you there was a way 
	to combine turkey, stuffing, gravy, peas, and mashed potatoes all in one dish? Well, let’s say you used ground turkey instead of whole turkey. Let’s say you cooked it with 
	aromatics and herbs that would normally go over the bread in stuffing, along with a roux and some chicken stock that would normally make a gravy. If you top it with some cheesy 
	mashed potatoes, what do you have? A shepherd’s pie! Well, technically there’s no lamb, so it’s a cottage pie, but you get the idea. All the classic smells and ingredients of a 
	Thanksgiving meal, all tucked into one big casserole dish.
	</p>
	<p class="story">
	That was the idea I had years ago, but unfortunately I never got the chance to make it until much later. I didn’t even make it for Thanksgiving, I just needed an excuse to 
	finally try it out. And I must say, it’s fantastic. It’s everything I thought it would be. Turkey, potato, gravy, all in one bite, with the rich, savory aromas of classic 
	Thanksgiving herbs. Delicious. The only problem is that I didn’t make enough of it.
	</p>
	<p class="story">
	Start by cooking the ground turkey on high heat in a pot or high-walled pan. The idea is to sear the meat and break it up, not to cook it all the way through. When you get 
	that sear and some fond on the bottom of the pan, set the turkey aside. In the same pan over medium-low heat, add a generous amount of butter along with diced onion, 
	diced celery, and minced garlic. Potatoes take a long time to boil, so while your aromatics are cooking, start boiling those potatoes in a separate pot. I prefer Yukon gold 
	potatoes, but russets work here too. Sprinkle a big pinch of flour onto the vegetables, then put the turkey back in with a spoonful of tomato paste. The tomato paste, while 
	it has nothing to do with Thanksgiving, will add a bit of acidity and help pick up any remaining fond from the bottom of the pan. Give the flour a chance to cook for a few 
	minutes, then slowly stream in your chicken stock, mixing constantly. Add your herbs along with a pinch of cayenne for some heat. You can add more than sage and thyme if you 
	would like, as long as it’s within the realm of Thanksgiving flavors. Let the mixture come up to a simmer, thicken, then take it off the heat and stir in the frozen peas.
	</p>
	<p class="story">
	By now the potatoes should be done, so remove them from the water, peel them, and let them dry out on some paper towels. Removing some moisture will help them be more fluffy. 
	Then add the milk and cheese to a bowl. Use however much cheese you prefer in your mashed potatoes, or even none at all if you don’t care for cheese. Put the milk and cheese 
	over a double boiler. If you didn’t dump out the water from boiling the potatoes, I recommend using that pot to create a double boiler easily. Then rice, grate, or strain out 
	the potatoes, depending on what utensils you have available. Put the potatoes in the double boiler and gently fold the mixture together with the hot milk and cheese. 
	Add salt to taste and take off the heat. Melt in 2 tablespoons of cold, cubed butter, using only a couple cubes at a time. Remember: hot milk, cold butter, perfect mashed 
	potatoes. Be sure not to mix the potatoes too much, as that makes them gluey and not fluffy.
	</p>
	<p class="story">
	Once all the butter is incorporated, put your mince that you set aside earlier into the casserole dish and gently top with a layer of mashed potato. Use a fork to create a 
	textured, craggy surface, and top with more cheese. Bake at 375F on the top rack of the oven until the cheese melts and the top gets browned. Cut squares using a spatula and 
	serve. This Thanksgiving-themed cottage pie is the first big experimental recipe I ever wrote. This idea and recipe are both entirely mine and I couldn’t be prouder of this pie. 
	Come to think of it, I have no idea why this even counts as a pie, but it’s so delicious that I don’t care.

	<!-- About the recipe -->
	<h4 class="subtitle has-text-centered is-4">Story Time</h4>
	<p class="story">
	One time, I was asking my friends their opinion about pineapple on pizza. But in a weird game of word association, my brain combined the words “pineapple upside-down cake” with 
	“pineapple on pizza” and I ended up saying, “What do you think about pineapple upside-down pizza?” My friends were confused by this, but it got me thinking. What is an 
	upside-down pizza? If you think about it, pizza normally has sauce with cheese and toppings above it, whereas in deep-dish pizza, the cheese and toppings are under the sauce. 
	Even though the crust is always on the bottom, deep-dish pie is really the closest mainstream variant of pizza that could be considered “upside-down”. So what if you made a 
	pineapple upside-down cake, but instead of cake it was a deep-dish pizza? After hours of research, diagramming, and writing, I settled on a recipe for the first ever 
	Pineapple Upside-Down Deep-Dish Pizza.
	</p>
	<p class="story">
	Basically, you take a pie dish (if you want straight edges on the crust, you should use a cake pan) and put down some pineapple rings in some melted butter with coins of 
	Italian sausage in the holes. Take deep-dish crust dough and line the edges, then fill up the pie dish with tomato sauce, then a layer of toppings, and cheese on top. 
	Cover the pie with a circle of dough and crimp the dough onto the dough around the sides to seal it. Create a couple steam vents on the top and bake it in the oven. The best 
	part is, while in the oven, because there’s crust on the top and sides of a pie dish, it looks like an ordinary pie to the casual observer. Wouldn’t they be shocked to see 
	that when you take it out of the oven and invert it, it was a deep-dish pizza all along! I know you’re asking, why even bake it upside down at all? It seems much simpler to 
	do it right side up. You’re right, but where’s the fun in that? Where’s the adventure? The childlike whimsy that comes with making a cake that’s actually a pizza that’s 
	actually a pie?
	</p>
	<p class="story">
	I already described more or less how to make it, but let’s get more into specifics. Start by making the dough. Special thanks to Omnivorous Adam for his deep-dish pizza crust 
	recipe. Mix the dry ingredients in a large bowl. Then mix in the olive oil until it becomes crumbly. Similar to a pie crust, it’s important to add the moisture last in as small 
	a quantity as possible. Add warm water (about body temperature) into the dough little by little until a shaggy dough forms. Cover the bowl with plastic wrap and let rest for 
	20 minutes. The yeast will begin feeding on the sugars in the flour and farting up a storm of carbon dioxide, which will cause the dough to rise. Knead the dough in 4 minute 
	intervals, resting for 4 minutes between intervals. By the end of 2 kneading intervals (12 mins) you should have a smooth dough. Turn it into a ball, return it to the bowl 
	and let it rest for another 2 hours.
	</p>
	<p class="story">
	While that’s rising, chop up your vegetables. I used onion, green bell pepper, and baby bella mushrooms. You can use more vegetables or none at all, it’s up to you. 
	Then grease the pie dish liberally with butter and sprinkle parmesan on the bottom and sides. Add melted butter to the bottom with some canned pineapple rings. Cut some 
	Italian sausage into coins and fit them into the pineapple rings to mimic the maraschino cherries on a pineapple upside-down cake. If you’re vegetarian, use whole black olives 
	instead, and if you’re vegan, don’t make this recipe. 
	</p>
	<p class="story">
	Once the dough has finished resting, it should have doubled in volume. Press it out (don’t roll it) on a clean countertop until about 2 inches wider than the outer rim of the 
	pie dish. Cut off any excess dough that would hang over the pie dish and use the excess dough to form a ring that goes around the inner walls of the pie dish. Fill up with 
	tomato sauce until you no longer see any pineapple or sausage, then add the toppings of your choice. If you want a recipe for homemade tomato sauce, I have one on this site. 
	The advantage to homemade is that you can control the moisture level. When I made this recipe, I reduced the sauce until most of the moisture was evaporated out to avoid steam 
	buildup in the pie. After putting in the sauce, add at least half a pound of low-moisture mozzarella (yes, that sounds like a lot. No, it is not too much cheese) and then a 
	layer of provolone slices. Make sure the cheese is flat on top, and not domed in the middle. Put the remaining circle of dough on top of the cheese and pinch it to the walls of 
	dough to attach them together. Sprinkle some extra parmesan on top and cut some vents in the top crust to let out steam. I’m not sure if that actually helps, considering the 
	cheese would  probably just seal it back up, but there’s no harm in doing it. Bake at 425F for 30-45 minutes. For me, the crust was a little burnt on the rim, so I would 
	recommend not going the full 45 minutes and instead checking the doneness by the color of the top crust. If it’s browned nicely, it should be about done. Let rest outside the 
	oven for at least 10 minutes before inverting onto a cutting board.

	There’s only one thing left to do before cutting a slice and eating. Take a moment to think about what you've done. Seriously, you spent hours on this, and for what? Not only 
	have you committed the cardinal sin of putting pineapple on pizza, you have also baked a deep dish pizza upside-down for no reason. Is it even a pizza anymore? Is it cake? 
	Is it pie? Is nothing sacred in the culinary realm? Are the boundaries that we use to define and distinguish food utterly meaningless? Look upon your unholy creation and 
	realize you have two options. Either allow yourself to well up with regret until you are laden with self-hatred and fear for what you've become... or revel in the delectable 
	mischief and chaos of your deeds. The forces of darkness have bestowed upon you the power to bend cuisine to your will and who are you to deny it? Be without bounds, shape, 
	form, or order. Transcend the meaning of creation through deconstruction. You are God now.

	<h4 class="subtitle has-text-centered is-4">Story Time</h4>
	<p class="story">
	I love the popcorn chicken a nearby boba place in town. I wanted to know if I could make this Taiwanese street food classic in my own kitchen with less effort than it would 
	take to go to the shop and buy some. By making chicken nuggets and tossing them in seasoned oil, you can get something that may not be quite as good, but it’s still absolutely 
	delicious. Whether you want to spice up your chicken nuggets gourmet-style or you want a simplified version of popcorn chicken you can make right at home, this is the recipe for 
	you. So here’s my take on a makeshift popcorn chicken.
	</p>
	<p class="story">
	The ingredient amounts are mostly in direct proportion to the number of nuggets you have. Follow the instructions for making the nuggets in the oven and count them before they 
	go in. I’m sorry in advance about all the math you’ll have to do, but I have no idea how else to describe the proportions of these ingredients. When they are about 5 minutes 
	away from being done, heat up some vegetable oil in a pan on high. Divide the number of nuggets by 10 and round up to get the amount of oil in tablespoons (i.e. for 21 nuggets, 
	use 3 tbsp oil because 21/10 = 2.1 gets rounded up to 3). While the oil heats up, roughly dice the garlic. Divide the number of nuggets by 5 and round up to get the number of 
	garlic cloves (i.e. for 21 nuggets, use 5 cloves because 21/5 = 4.1 gets rounded up to 5).
	</p>
	<p class="story">
	Once the oil is hot, add red pepper flakes for some heat along with a hefty amount of ginger powder. Add the basil right away, and be sure to use fresh basil leaves only. 
	The flavor and texture of fresh, whole basil leaves when fried is inimitable. Divide the number of nuggets by 5, multiply by 3, and round up to get the number of basil leaves 
	(i.e. for 21 nuggets, use 13 basil leaves because (21/5)*3 = 12.3 rounded up to 13). Be careful when adding in the basil, as it will flash fry and splutter oil everywhere. 
	Take off the heat after 10 seconds (not a second more) and add the garlic, a heavy shake of paprika, onion powder, and black pepper. If you happen to have white pepper and 
	ground Szechuan peppercorns, you should use those instead of the black pepper. Once the flavors have a chance to assimilate, cool them off with a glug of soy sauce and mix 
	until homogenous.
	</p>
	<p class="story">
	By now the nuggets should be done, so take them out of the oven, put them in a large bowl, sprinkle with a bit of salt, and give them a little toss. Pour the seasoned oil over 
	the nuggets, making sure to use a spatula to get out all the powdery bits and every last drop of oil. Toss together, making sure all the nuggets get covered in oil, and then 
	serve hot. This may not be the best popcorn chicken you’ll ever have, but I guarantee it’ll be the best chicken nuggets of your life.

	<p class="story">
	This recipe is literally just Joshua Weissman’s recipe but missing a few ingredients that I don’t have in my kitchen. The meatballs still taste fantastic and go great with 
	spaghetti, meatball subs, or even just by themselves.
	</p>
	<p class="story">
	Mix 1 pound of ground beef with some parmesan, breadcrumbs, an egg, salt, minced garlic, and pepper in a bowl. The reason we add so much other stuff to the meat is for both 
	seasoning and also breaking up the meat so that it falls apart in your mouth delicately rather than seizing up and becoming tight. Once homogenous, form it into balls. 
	I usually end up with 15 if I’m going for bigger meatballs, but if you’re not cooking them in sauce, I recommend going to ping pong ball size. Fry them in batches in a few 
	tablespoons of shimmering hot olive oil on medium-high until a crust forms on the outside. Make sure to turn the meatballs every once in a while so they get a crust on every 
	side. If they’re being cooked in sauce, take them out and use the oil to make tomato sauce. If you don’t want to make homemade sauce, discard the oil and put in the store-bought 
	sauce. In either case, when the sauce is simmering, add the meatballs back in and let simmer covered for a minimum of 10 minutes on low with the lid on.
	</p>
	<p class="story">
	If you don’t want to use sauce at all to simmer them, put all the meatballs back in the pan and cook them on medium-low for 15 minutes with the lid on. You can always check 
	if they’re done by cutting a sacrificial one open. If it’s still pink, keep going. Medium-rare is unsafe if you’re using ground meat. When they’re ready, eat them however you 
	prefer, just try not to fit them all in your mouth at once.

	<!-- About the recipe -->
	<h4 class="subtitle has-text-centered is-4">Story Time</h4>
	<p class="story">
	I remember when I was alone in my apartment one time for Thanksgiving break. Normally, spending Thanksgiving alone is sad, but for me, I got the chance to make a six course feast 
	all to myself. Deviled eggs, pasta aglio e olio, turkey and mashed potato sandwiches, fruit salad, tomato soup, and lemon meringue pie. The whole thing took me 24 hours and I 
	ate it all by myself in 3 days. The appetizers for this feast, deviled eggs, were something I'd never tried before. I got this recipe from AllRecipes and tried it out. In short, 
	I ended up wolfing down half a dozen eggs because these little bites of pure richness were too good to put down.
	</p>
	<p class="story">
	Start by putting 6 eggs in a pot of water, then bring up to a boil. Once it begins boiling, turn off the heat. Let sit for 10-12 minutes. Remove the eggs and put them in a bowl 
	of ice water to prevent them from overcooking. Peel the eggs and cut lengthwise. If you want to call it quits here and just eat hardboiled eggs, I don’t blame you. But if you 
	want to finish the recipe, the next step is to remove the yolks and mash them in a bowl with a fork. Add mayo, mustard, salt, pepper, and a dash or two of hot sauce. Stir until 
	smooth and creamy. Taste for seasoning and adjust as necessary. Pipe the yolk mixture back into the egg whites. I like putting the mixture in a plastic baggie, then cutting off 
	a corner and using that as a makeshift piping bag. Garnish each egg with cayenne pepper and a sprig of parsley. This appetizer is perfect for any party or feast of your choosing. 
	I'd have to say the hardest part of this recipe is resisting the urge to eat them all before someone else gets a chance to try.

	<h4 class="subtitle has-text-centered is-4">Story Time</h4>
	<p class="story">
	This recipe is from Ethan Chlebowski’s recipe for spicy garlicky weeknight pizza. I’ve tried making pizza from scratch in the past and it never worked (except for pineapple 
	upside-down deep-dish pizza, but that’s another story). I have yet to try this one out, but it looks easy to do, and with the right patience, I think I can finally make myself 
	some good pizza.
	</p>
	<p class="story">
	Start by putting the yeast in warm water with a spoonful of flour. Stir and let sit for 5 minutes. The warm water will activate the yeast and they will begin feeding on the 
	flour (if they are alive). If so, the yeast will begin foaming. If not, the yeast is dead. Start over with new yeast. Combine salt and flour in a large bowl, then add the yeasty 
	water to it. Combine by hand for 2 minutes until cohesive. This dough is very well hydrated, even for pizza, so it will be sticky. Be patient, stay calm, use flour to get excess 
	dough off your hands. Just trust the process. Cover and let the dough rest for 15 minutes.
	</p>
	<p class="story">
	Dip your fingers in cold water, pull one side of the dough, fold it onto itself, and repeat the process around the circumference of the dough. Turn out onto a clean countertop. 
	Knead by slapping the dough onto the counter and folding over for about 5 minutes until it passes a windowpane test. The windowpane test is used to check if gluten has developed 
	enough in a dough. Try stretching out a piece of a dough into a rectangle in your hand, as thin as possible. So thin that light can pass through it. If it can hold as a 
	rectangle that thin, the gluten is well developed. Cover and let rest for 40 minutes back in the bowl.
	</p>
	<p class="story">
	Drizzle olive oil on it and fold it over on itself like you did before. Divide it in half, since this is enough for 2 pizzas. Form into balls on the counter, drizzle olive oil 
	into the bowl, and put the dough balls back in. Rest for another 30 minutes. Take out a ball, shape it into a pizza on your pizza cooking surface, top with sauce, cheese, 
	and whatever else you like. Bake at 450F on the top rack for a few minutes until the crust looks done and the cheese has melted.
